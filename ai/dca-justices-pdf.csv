Appellate District, Division Three, August 29, 1994 to June 30, 2017 .  
Appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson.  
 
Ventura County Superior Court, 1991 -1994.  
 
Judge of the Superior Court, County of Ventura, California, January 1991 
to August 1994.  Appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian.  
 
In 1992, Judge Aldrich was instrumental in inaugurating  Ventura 
County’s Multi -Door Courthouse .  Patterned after a 1976 concept of 
Prof. Frank Sander of the Harvard Law School, this program provides 
litigants with multiple modalities for early resolution of their disputes without trial.  These modalities 
include arbitration, mediation, settlement conferences and other procedures allowing early intervention by 
the judge to attempt to effect settlement before the expenditure of time and expense of protracted 
litigation.  This program still exists in Ventura with a success rate of over 40% settlements without trial.  
 
In 1992 Judge Aldrich was the recipient of the “Trial Judge of the Year”  award presented by the 
Ventura County Trial Lawyers Association.  
 
In 1992 and again in 1993 Judge Aldrich was selected as the “Outstanding Jurist of the Year” by the 
Ventura County Bar Association . 
 
From 1992 to 1994 Judge Aldrich  was Chair of the “Alternative Dispute Resolution  Committee”  for the 
Ventura Courts and was the founding Chair of the “Bench, Bar Media Committee” .  This committee was 
started by Judge Aldrich to promote better understanding between the judiciary, the bar and the media.  
He also chaired the “Fiscal and Budget” and  “New Legislation and Rules Committees”.  
 
In February, 1993, Judge Aldrich, who is himself disa bled, fulfilled his promise to a meeting of 
“Employment of Attorneys with Disabilities” to make California the first state in the nation to adopt a 
mechanism for persons with disabilities using California Courts to ask for and receive special 
accommodation s permitting them greater access the our courts.  In early 1993, he composed the original 
draft a measure that was adopted by the California Judicial Council in 1996 as Rule of Court 983.3, 
“Requests for accommodations by persons with disabilities.”   Earlier, largely through the efforts of 
Justice Aldrich, a similar measure was adopted by the California State Bar Board of Governors.   
 
California Court of Appeal, 1994 to 2017 . 
 
Justice Aldrich was elevated to the California Court of Appeal, Second Appellate  District, Division Three 
in 1994  where he served until his retirement, June 30, 2017 .    
 
In 1994 , Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas appointed Justice Aldrich as Chair of the  Select Committee on 
Trial Court Coordination Implementation .  The findings and recomme ndations of this “blue ribbon” 
commission were the precursor to Trial Court Unification that now exists in all counties in California.  In 
1996 , Chief Justice Lucas appointed Justice Aldrich Chair of the Business Court Study Task  Force .  
This committee was  charged with investigating the desirability and the feasibility of establishing business  
courts in California.   
 In 1995 , Justice Aldrich was instrumental in inaugurating the “Second District Appellate Settlement 
Conference and  Mediation Program.”   Under  the auspices of the Alternative Dispute Resolution 
Committee, the program has recruited experienced appellate practitioners to act as mediators and 
settlement conference officers.  As a result of this program, each year over  30% of pending appeals are 
being resolved before the time and expense of briefing and preparation of the appellate record.  
 
In 1997 , Chief Justice Ronald M. George asked Justice Aldrich to Chair the  Complex Litigation Task 
Force  for the California Judicial Council.  This task force cre ated a program to facilitate the management 
and disposition of all types of complex litigation (including complex business and tort cases) in the courts 
of California.  Under the leadership of Justice Aldrich, the Task Force published a definitive  “Deskboo k 
on the Management of Complex Civil  Cases”  which has become the model against which other similar 
programs are evaluated by other state court systems across the nation.  The Task Force formulated 
California Rules of Court and  Standards of Judicial Adminis tration  to implement complex litigation 
programs in California courts and recommended statutory changes to the legislature.  The committee also 
established 6 pilot programs in major urban centers in California including Los Angeles, Orange, San 
Francisco, Alameda, Contra Costa and Santa Clara counties.  The Task Force in conjunction with the 
Center for Judicial Education and Research  also created curricula  to instruct trial judges in the most 
advanced case management techniques available to more efficiently  handle complex civil cases.  The 
goal of this project is to better serve the public by providing a fast, efficient and economical way to resolve 
complex civil disputes.  
 
From 1998 to 2002, Justice Aldrich was appointed by the Chief Justice to the Judicial  Council of 
California . The Judicial Council is the constitutionally created governing committee of the judicial branch 
of government charged with the operation and administration of all the courts in the state of California. 
During his tenure on the Judic ial Council, Justice Aldrich served as Vice -Chair of the Policy Committee  
and he also served on the Executive Committee  and the Rules and Projects  standing committees.  
 
Justice Aldrich chaired the Judicial Council’s Civil and Small Claims Standing Advisory  Committee, 
its Case Management and Delay Reduction subcommittee.  I n 1997 and again in 2003, Justice 
Aldrich Chaired the California Judicial Administration Conference .  He chaired the Blue Ribbon 
Panel of Experts on the Fair and Efficient Administration o f Civil Cases  in 2003.  This panel brought 
consensus among many competing legal constituencies to unify delay reduction standards to allow for 
faster and more efficient resolution of civil cases in the court system.  In 2004, he chaired the Court Fees 
Work ing Group  of the Judicial Council.  This committee established uniform statewide filing fees to 
equalize and more equitably distribute filing fee revenue in each of the 58 counties in California.  
 
From  2004  to 2007 , Justice  Aldrich was chair of the Judicia l Council’s  Court Security Working Group.  
This committee is composed of representatives from the courts, the legislature, security chiefs, the State 
Sheriff’s Association, labor unions and the public.  This committee has established uniform funding 
standa rds for court security throughout the state of California.   
 
For 19 years, from 1992 to 2011, Justice Aldrich was on the faculty of the B.E. Witkin California Judicial 
College  where he t aught  “Civil Settlement Techniques.”   This was an interactive class t hat was designed 
to enable even the novice civil judge to effectively conduct civil settlement conferences.  The highlight of 
the course was an actual settlement conference conducted by Justice Aldrich in front of the class with the 
actual lawyers and prin cipals involved in the case participating.   He has also taught and lectured to 
judges and attorneys in the United States and abroad.

PERSONAL   
  
 Married to United States District Judge Margaret  Morrow, and parent of Patrick Morrow Boland  Second District Court of Appeal is sad to announce the 
passing of its esteemed colleague Justice Paul Boland, Associate Justice of Division Eight. 
 
Funeral services were held Saturday, Septembe r 8, 2007for Justice Paul Boland, a distinguished 
member of the Court of Appeal, Second Appe llate District, Division Eight, who died 
unexpectedly at an area hospital on Wednesday evening after a brief illness.  He was 65 years of 
age. 
 
 “The passing of Justice Paul Boland is a treme ndous loss to California's judiciary,” declared 
Chief Justice Ronald M. George. “My friendship with him dates back to the 1970's, before his 
initial appointment to the bench.  He was a warm  and insightful individual,  possessing great legal 
and personal skills, and was an outstanding ju rist and President of the California Judges 
Association.”    
  
“The sudden passing of our friend and colleague Justice Paul Boland is a great blow to all of us 
in the Second Appellate District of the Court of  Appeal,” said Administrative Presiding Justice 
Roger Boren of the Second Appellate  District.  “His death is not only a considerable professional 
loss to this court, but his departure from our liv es will weigh heavily on all of us who knew him.  
He was a towering figure in the le gal and judicial community of th e State of California.  More 
importantly those who have been fortunate to know Justice Boland for many years were keenly 
aware about his kind and considerate nature and how he always made every person with whom 
he was in contact feel important and needed.” 
 
Presiding Justice Boren continued, “I first kne w him when I was an older student at UCLA 
School of Law and Paul was a member of the law school faculty.  Later we shared adjacent court 
rooms in the superior court and served together  on the Judicial Council.  His intelligent and 
helpful suggestions and advice were always gi ven with humility and friendship.  He was a unique 
and wonderful person.” 
 
Presiding Justice Norman Epstein, of the Court of Appeal, Second Appella te District, Division 
Four, noted, “Paul Boland was the nicest, most  compassionate person I ever have known. He 
exuded those qualities, as well as so many others , to everyone who had th e privilege of knowing 
him. For any who would seek to identify someone who personifies the accolade ‘mensch,’ look no further. He is the one.” 
 
A California judge for 26 years, Justice Boland served on the Court of Appeal, Division Eight, 
since 2001. During his service as an appellate justice, he authored hundreds of opinions. He 
directed the court’s Judicial Ex ternship Program, which just rece ived one of 9 statewide awards 
for judicial innovation and excellence.  The pr ogram will receive a Ralph N. Kleps Award for 
Improvement in the Administration of the Courts at Judicial Council luncheon in Anaheim on 
September 27, 2007.  Before his appointment to the Court of Appeal, Justice  Boland served for two decades on the 
Superior Court of Los Angeles County, where he handled civil, criminal, family, and juvenile 
assignments.  He also was supervising judge  of both the Child Dependency Court and the 
Eastlake Juvenile Delinquency Court, before becoming presiding judge of the 50 Los Angeles 
County Juvenile Courts.  
As presiding judge, he supervised the design and construction of the Children’s Court, the 
nation’s first courthouse built to hear cases invo lving abused and neglected children.  He also 
established drug treatment programs for parents, youth and children in juve nile proceedings, and 
a policy for independent representati on of children in dependency cases. 
While on the Superior Court, Boland was president of the Californi a Judges Association, 
representing the state’s 2,500 judge s.  For 5 years, he also served on the Judicial Council of 
California, the policy-making body fo r the California courts, chaired by Chief Justice Ronald M. 
George.  In addition, he served for 15 months as  an assigned justice of  the Court of Appeal, 
Second Appellate District.  
 
Before his judicial career, Justice Boland served as a law clerk on the U.S.  District Court and a 
litigator with the Western Center  on Law and Poverty. He was one of three law professors who 
later established the Clin ical Legal Education Program at UCLA School of Law, where he served 
for 11 years as law professor, associate dea n, and director of clin ical legal education. 
 
Among his many honors, Justice Boland received the Los Angeles County Bar Association 
Outstanding Jurist Award; California Trial Lawyers Jurist of the Year; Consumer Attorneys 
Association of Los Angeles’ R oger Traynor Appellate Justice of the Year Award; and the Alfred 
McCourtney Trial Judge of the Year Award; Juven ile Courts Bar Associa tion Judge of the Year 
Award; Constitutional Rights Foundation Judge of the Year Award; and Irish American Bar Association Daniel O’Connell Awar d.  He also is recipient of the Loyola Marymount University 
Distinguished Alumnus Award.   He served on the Board of Regents of both Loyola Marymount 
University and Loyola High School. 
 
Justice Boland is survived by his wife, U.S. Di strict Judge Margaret Morrow Boland, and their 
son, Patrick.  
 
In lieu of flowers, the family requests that memorial contributions be made to the Paul Boland 
Memorial Fund which will provide much need ed scholarships.  The address for such 
contributions is c/o the Calif ornia Community Foundation, 445 South Figueroa, Suite 3400, Los 
Angeles, California 90071."
