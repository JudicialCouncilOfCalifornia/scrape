INFORMATION ON APPEAL PROCEDURES FOR UNLIMITED CIVIL CASES  
 
The following is general information about the procedures for appeals of unlimited civil cases (“unlimited civil case"" 
generally means a civil case in which the amount in controversy is more than $ 25,000; see Code of Civil  Procedure 
sections 85 and 88). This information is not intended to be comprehensive, but to provide an overview to help guide 
you through the appeal process. You should thoro ughly read rules 8.100-  8.276 of  the California Rules o f 
Court. If you have questions about the appellate process, you should consult an  attorney of your own 
choosing.  
 
1. NATURE OF AN APPEAL  
 
An appeal is a review of a court's decision by another court. A party may appeal an unfavorable judgment  and 
certain orders in an unlimited civil case made in the superior court to the Court of Appeal for the district  in which 
the superior court is located. General ly, the appeal must be based on an argument that a legal  error was made 
by the superior court. An appeal is not a retrial. You will not be perm itted to introduce new  evidence,  and the 
appellate court will not reassess conflicting evidence. You may not appeal on behalf of a friend, a spouse, a 
child, or other relative (unless you are a legally appointed guar dian). 
 2. PARTI ES 
 
The party filing the appeal is called the APPELLANT. The party against whom the appeal is brought is  called the 
RESPONDENT.  
 
STEPS IN THE APPEAL PROCESS AT THE SUPERIOR COURT  
 
3. NOTICE OF APPEAL  
 
To appeal from a superior court decision in an unlimit ed civil case, the appellant must file a notice of appeal  in 
the superior court (Cal. Rules of Court. rule 8.100). A notice of appeal tells the other party or parties in  the 
case and the superior court that you are appealing the decision of the superior court. You may use  Judicial 
Council form APP -002, Notice of Appeal/Cross -Appeal (Unlimited Civil Case), to file a notice of  appeal in an 
unlimited civil case.  
 
The notice of appeal must be served on the other party or parties in the case and filed with the c lerk of the 
superior court. Generally, this service and filing must be completed within 60 calendar days after the clerk  or a 
party serves either a notice of entry of judgment or a file- stamped copy of the judgment. If neither of  these 
documents is served,  the notice of appeal must be filed within 180 calendar days after entry of  judgment 
(generally the date the judgment is file- stamped). If your notice of appeal is filed late, your  appeal will be 
dismissed  (Cal. Rules of Court, rules 8.104 and 8.108).  
 
If a notice of appeal has been filed in a case, any other party to the case may file its own appeal f rom the same 
judgment or order. This is called a cross -appea l. To cross -appeal, a party must file a notice  of appeal  within 
either the regular time for filing a notice of appeal or within 20 days after the clerk of the superior  court mails 
notice of the first appeal, whichever is later (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.108). You may use Judicial Council form 
APP- 002, Notice of Appeal/Cross -Appeal (Unlimited Civil Case), to file this notice in an unlimited civil case.  
 4. FEE ON APPEAL  
 
The notice of appeal must be accompanied by the $775 filing fee required by Govern ment Code sections  68926 
and 68926.1. Checks for this fee must be made payable to “Clerk , Court of Appeal .” In addition, it  must be 
accompanied by the $ 100 deposit required by Government Code section 68926.1. Checks for this  deposit must 
be made payable to “C lerk of the Superior Court. ” If you do not have the money for the fees,  you may submit an 
application for waiver of court fees and costs on appeal under ru les 8.26 and 3.50- 3.63 of the Cali fornia Ru les of 
Court (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.100).  
 
5. DESIGNATION OF RECORD 
 
See rules 8.130 -8.163 of the California Rules of Court, which govern the preparation of the record on appeal .  
 [Rev. Jan. 1, 2014]  INFORMATION ON APPEAL PROCEDURES FOR UNLIMITED CIVIL CASES  
(Appellate)  Page 2 of 4 
 APP-001-2DCA  
 
Since the appellate court was not present at the trial or other proceedings in the superior court, there must be an 
official record of the proceedings from the superior court for the appellate court to review in assessing the 
appeal.  Within 10 days of filing the notice of appeal, the appellant must tell the superior  court in writing 
(“designate” ) what documents and oral proceedings, if any, to include in the record that  will be sent to the Court 
of Appeal. You will need to designate a ll the parts of the record that the  Court of Appeal will need to 
decide the issues you raise in the appeal.  You can use Judicial  Council form APP -003, Notice Designating 
Record on Appeal (Unlimited Civil Case) to designate the record in an unlimited civil case.  
 
Reporter 's Transcript  
 
A court reporter's transcript is a written record (often called the “ verbatim ” record) of the oral  proceedings in 
the superior court. A reporter's transcript is not required but is usual ly necessary.   
 
Within 10 days of filin g the notice of appeal, the appellant must serve and file with the superior  court clerk 
either a notice designating a reporter's transcript or a notice of intent to proceed without  a reporter's 
transcript (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.130). You can use Judi cial Council form  APP- 003, Appell ant's Notice 
Designating Record on Appeal (Unlimited Civil Case) to file this notice  in an unlimited civil case.  
 
If the appellant chooses to designate a reporter's transcript, the notice designating this transcript  must 
specify the date of each proceeding to be included in the transcript and must be served on each known 
court reporter (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.130). The names of the court reporters who reported the 
proceedings are found in the superior court clerk's minute orders, which are prepared for each day of the 
proceedings and then placed in the superior court file.  
 
With the notice designating the reporter's transcript, the appellant must deposit the approximate cost of 
trans cribing the proceedings designated (Ca l. Rules of Court, rule 8.130). The cost may be obtained from 
the reporter's written estimate or calculated at $650 per day (more than three hours  of court time) or $325 
per fraction of a day (less than three hours of court time) (Cal. Rules of  Court, rule  8.130).  
 
Within 10 days after service of the appellant's designation of the reporter's transcript, the respondent may 
serve and fil e a notice designating additional proceedings to be included in the reporter's transcript (Cal. 
Rules of Court, rule 8.130).  Respondent must pay for the cost of  transcribing any additional proceedings 
designated.  
 
If the appellant chooses to proceed without a reporter's transcript, the respondent may not  designate a 
reporter's transcript without first obtaining an order from the reviewing court (Cal Rules  of Court, rule 8.130).  
 
Clerk's Transcript or Appendix  
 
The clerk's transcript is a compilation of the documents filed in the superior court. Within 10 days of  filing the 
notice of appeal, the appellant must serve and file with the superior court cler k a notice either designating 
the documents from the court file that the appellant wants the superior court to include in the clerk's 
transcript (Cal Rules of Court, rule 8.122) or a notice of intent to prepare his  or her own compil ation of these 
documents, called an appendix (Cal. Rules of Court , rule 8.124).  You can use Judicial Council form APP -
003, Appellant's Notice Designating Record on Appeal  (Unlimited Civil Case) to file this notice in an 
unlimited civil case.  
 
If the appell ant chooses to designate a clerk's transcript, each document designated for inclusion in the 
clerk’s transcript must be identified by its title and filing date. I f the filing date is not known,  the date the 
document was signed may be used instead (Cal. Ru les of Court, rule 8.122).   
 
Within 10 days after service of a notice designating the documents to be included in the clerk's  transcript, 
respondent may serve and file a notice designating addi tional documents to be  included in the clerk's 
transcript (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.122 ).  
 The superior court clerk will send the appellant a bill for the cost of preparing an original and one  copy of the 
transcript (Cal Rules of Court, rule 8.122). This must be paid within 10 days or the  appeal may be dismissed 
by the Court of Appeal.  
  
 [Rev. Jan. 1, 2014]  INFORMATION ON APPEAL PROCEDURES FOR UNLIMITED CIVIL CASES  
(Appellate)  Page 3 of 4 
 APP-001-2DCA  
If the appellant chooses to prepare an appendix of the documents filed in the superior court, rather  than 
designating a clerk's transcript, that appendix must include all of the documents and be prepared in the form 
required by Calif ornia Rules of Court, rule 8.124. The parties may prepare separate appendixes but are 
encouraged to stipulate (agree) to a joint appendix. If separate appendixes are prepared, each party must 
pay for its own appendix. If a joint appendix is prepared,  the parties can agree on how the cost of preparing 
the appendix will be paid or the cost will be paid  by the appellant(s)  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.124 ).  
 
6. FILING OF CLERK'S AND REPORTER'S TRANSCRIPTS (If ANY)  
 
If the appellant chooses to designate a cler k's transcript, after all the fees have been paid, the superior  court 
clerk will compile the requested documents into a transcript format and forward the original cler k's transcript. 
together with the original reporter's transcript, if any, to the Court of Appeal for filing. A copy of  the transcript(s) 
will be sent to the appellant. I f the respondent has purchased a copy, the clerk 's transcript  will also be mailed to 
the respondent (Cal. Rules of Court, rules 8.122, 8.130, and 8.150).  
 7. ABANDONMENT OF APPEAL  
 
If the appellant decides not to proceed with the appeal and the record has not yet been filed in the Court  of 
Appeal, the appellant must file an abandonment of appeal in the superior court (Cal Rules of Court,  rule 8.244). 
You can use Judicial Council form APP- 005, Abandonment of Appeal (Unlimited Civil Case),  for this purpose.  
 
STEPS IN THE APPEAL PROCESS AT THE COURT OF APPEAL  
 
8. CIVIL CASE INFORMATION STATEMENT  
 
Within 15 days after the superior court  clerk mails the notification of the filing of the notice of appeal required by 
(e)(1), the appellant must serve and file in the reviewing court a completed Civil Case Information Statement  
(form APP- 004), attaching a copy of the judgment or appealed order that shows the date it was entered (Cal. 
Rules of Court,  rule 8.100(g)(1)).  
 9. SERVING AND FILING APPENDIX IN LIEU OF CLERK'S TRANSCRIPT  
 
If a party chooses to prepare an appendix of the documents filed in the superior court under rule 8.124 rather 
than designating a clerk's transcript, the party preparing the ap pendix must serve the appendix on each other 
party (unless the parties have  agreed or the Court of Appeal has ordered otherwise) and file the appendi x in the 
Court of Appeal . A joint appendix or an appellant's appendix must be served and file with the appellant's 
opening brief. A respondent's appendix, if any, must be served and filed with the respondent's brief. An 
appellant's reply appendix, if any, must be served and filed with the appellant's  reply brief (Cal. Rules of Court, 
rule 8.124).  
 10. BRIEFS

Page 1 of 2APP-015/FW-015-INFO 
INFORMATION SHEET ON WAIVER OF APPELLATE COURT FEES 
SUPREME COURT, COURT OF APPEAL, APPELLATE DIVISION —
If you file an appeal, a petition for a writ, or a petition for review in a civil case, such as a family law case or a case in 
which you sued someone or someone sued you, you must generally pay a filing fee to the court. If you are a party other 
than the party who filed the appeal or the petition, you must also generally pay a fee when you file your first document in 
a case in the Court of Appeal or Supreme Court. You and the other parties in the case may also have to pay other court 
fees in these proceedings, such as fees to prepare or get a copy of a clerk’s transcript in an appeal. However, if you cannot 
afford to pay these court fees and costs, you may ask the court to issue an order saying you do not have to pay these fees 
(this is called “waiving” these fees).  
1.  Who can get their court fees waived? The court will waive your court fees and costs if: 
• You are getting public assistance, such as Medi-Cal; Food Stamps; Supplemental Security Income ( not Social 
Security); State Supplemental Payment; County Relief/General Assistance; In-Home Supportive Services; 
CalWORKS; Tribal Temporary Assistance for Needy  Families; Cash Assistance Program for Aged, Blind, and 
Disabled; Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC Program); or 
unemployment compensation. 
You have a low income level . Under the law you are considered a low-income person if the gross monthly  income 
(before deductions for taxes) of your household is less than the amount listed below: 
Family Size Family Income Family Size Family Income Family Size Family Income 
1 $2,430.00 3 $4,143.34 5 $5,856.67
2 $3,286.67 4 $5,000.00 6 $6,713.34If more than 6 people at  
home, add $856.67 for  
each extra person. • 
You do not have enough income to pay for your household’s basic needs and your court fees. • 
2.  What fees and costs will the court waive? If you qualify for a fee waiver, the Supreme Court, Court 
of Appeal, or Appellate Division will waive the filing fee for the notice of appeal, a petition for a writ, a petition for 
review, or the first document filed by a party other than the party who filed the appeal or petition, and any court fee for 
participating in oral argument by telephone. The trial court will also waive costs related to the clerk’s transcript on appeal, 
the fee for the court to hold in trust the deposit for a reporter's transcript on appeal under rule 8.130(b) or rule 8.834(b) of 
the California Rules of Court, and the fees for making a transcript or copy of an official electronic recording under rule 
8.835. If you are the appellant (the person who is appealing the trial court decision), the fees waived include the deposit 
required under Government Code section 68926.1 and the costs for preparing and certifying the clerk’s transcript and 
sending the original to the reviewing court and one copy to you. If you are the respondent (a party other than the appellant 
in a case that is being appealed), the fees waived include the costs for sending you a copy of the clerk’s transcript. You 
can also ask the trial court to waive other necessary court fees and costs.  
The court cannot waive the fees for preparing a reporter’s transcript in a civil case. A special fund, called the Transcript 
Reimbursement Fund, may help pay for the transcript. (See  www.courtreportersboard.ca.gov/ consumers/index.shtml#trf  
and Business and Professions Code sections 8030.2 and following for more information about this fund.) If you are unable 
to pay the cost of a reporter’s transcript, a record of the oral proceedings can be prepared in other ways, by preparing an 
agreed statement or, in some circumstances, a statement on appeal or settled statement.  
3.  How do I ask the court to waive my fees?
Appeal in Limited Civil Case (civil case in which the amount of money claimed is $25,000 or less). In a limited 
civil case, if the trial court already issued an order waiving your court fees and that fee waiver has  not ended (fee 
waivers automatically end 60 days after the judgment), the fees and costs identified in item 2 above are already waived; 
just give the court a copy of your current fee  waiver. If you do not already have an order waiving your fees or you had 
a fee waiver but it has ended, you must complete and file a  Request to Waive Court Fees  (form FW-001). If you are the 
appellant (the party  who is appealing), you should check both boxes in item 4 on FW-001 and file the completed form 
with your notice of appeal. If you are the respondent (a party other than the appellant in a case that is being appealed), 
the completed form should be filed in the court when the fees you are requesting to be waived, such as the fee for the 
clerk’s transcript or telephonic oral argument, are due.• Rev. April 1, 2023INFORMATION SHEET ON WAIVER OF APPELLATE COURT FEES 
SUPREME COURT, COURT OF APPEAL, APPELLATE DIVISION— APP-015/FW-015-INFO 
Page 2 of 2Writ Proceeding in Limited Civil Case (civil case in which the amount of money claimed is $25,000 or less). If 
you want the Superior Court to waive the fees in a writ proceeding in a limited civil case, you must complete a Request 
to Waive Court Fees  (form FW-001). In item 4 on FW-001, check the second box. The completed form should be filed 
with your petition for a writ.  • 
If You Are a Guardian or Conservator. If you are a guardian or conservator or a petitioner for the appointment of a 
guardian or conservator, special rules apply to your request for a fee waiver on an appeal from an order in the 
guardianship or conservatorship proceeding or in a civil action in which you are a party acting on behalf of your ward 
or conservatee. Complete and submit a Request to Waive Court Fees (Ward or Conservatee) (form FW-001-GC) to 
request a fee waiver. See California Rules of Court, rule 7.5.• 
Appeal in Other Civil Cases.  If you want the court to waive fees and costs in an appeal in a civil case other than a 
limited civil case, such as a family law case or an unlimited civil case (a civil case in which the  amount of money 
claimed is more than $25,000), you must complete a Request to Waive Court Fees  (form  FW-001). In item 4 on 
FW-001, check the second box to ask the Court of Appeal to waive the fee for filing  the notice of appeal or, if you are a 
respondent (a party other than the one who filed the appeal), the fee for  the first document you file in the Court of 
Appeal. Check both boxes if you also want the trial court to  waive your costs for the clerk’s transcript (if the trial court 
already issued an order waiving your fees and that fee waiver has not ended,  you do not need to check the first box; the 
fees and costs identified in item 2 above are already waived, just give the court a copy of your current fee waiver). If 
you are the appellant, the  completed form should be submitted with your notice of appeal (if you check both boxes in 
item 4, the court may ask for two signed copies of this form). If you are the respondent, the completed form should be  
submitted at the time the fee you are asking the court to waive is due. For example, file the form in the trial court with 
your request for a copy of the clerk’s transcript if you are asking the court to waive the transcript  fee or file the form in 
the Court of Appeal with the first document you file in that court if you are asking the  court to waive the fee for filing 
that document. To request waiver of a court fee for telephonic oral  argument, you should file the completed form in the 
Court of Appeal when the fee for telephonic oral argument is due.  • 
Writ Proceeding in Other Civil Cases. If you want the Supreme Court or Court of Appeal to waive the  fees and costs  
in a writ proceeding in a civil case other than a limited civil case, such as a family law case or an unlimited civil case (a 
civil case in which the amount of money claimed is more than $25,000), you must  complete a  Request to Waive Court 
Fees (form FW-001). If you are the petitioner (the party filing the  petition), the completed form should be submitted   
with your petition for a writ in the Supreme Court or  Court of Appeal clerk’s office. If you are a party other than the 
petitioner, the completed form should be filed with the first document you file in the Supreme Court or Court of Appeal. • 
Petition for Review. If you want to request that the Supreme Court waive the fees in a petition for review  proceeding, 
you must complete a Request to Waive Court Fees  (form FW-001) or a Request to Waive Court Fees (Ward or 
Conservatee) (form FW-001-GC). If you are the petitioner, you should submit the completed form with your petition 
for review. If you are a party other than the  petitioner, the completed form should be filed with the first document you 
file in the Supreme Court. • 
IMPORTANT INFORMATION! 
Fill out your request completely and truthfully. When you sign your request for a fee waiver, you are  declaring 
under penalty of perjury that the information you have provided is true and correct. • 
The court may ask you for information and evidence. You may be ordered to go to court to answer questions about 
your ability to pay court fees and costs and to provide proof of eligibility. Any initial fee waiver you are granted may 
be ended if you do not go to court when asked. You may be ordered to repay amounts that were waived if the court 
finds you were not eligible for the fee waiver.  • 
If you receive a fee waiver, you must tell the court if there is a change in your finances. You must tell  the court 
immediately if your finances improve or if you become able to pay court fees or costs during this  case (file form 
FW-010 with the court). You may be ordered to repay any amounts that were waived after your eligibility ended. If the 
trial court waived your fees and costs and you settle your case for $10,000 or more, the trial court will have a lien on 
the settlement in the amount of the waived fees. • 
The fee waiver ends. The fee waiver expires 60 days after the judgment, dismissal, or other final disposition of the 
case or when the court finds that you are not eligible for a fee waiver.   •","This form is for people who cannot afford to pay court fees when filing an appeal, petition, or other document in a civil case. The court may waive court fees and costs if the person has a low income level or is receiving public assistance. The court may also waive other court fees and costs that are necessary for the case. To request a fee waiver, the person must fill out a Request to Waive Court Fees form. The form should be filed with the notice of appeal, petition for a writ, petition for review, or the first document filed in the court. The court may ask for more information or evidence to confirm the person's eligibility for a fee waiver. If the person's finances change during the case, they must notify the court. The fee waiver ends after 60 days or if the court finds the person is no longer eligible."

APPELLATE SETTLEMENT 
(Fourth Appellate District) GUIDELINES FOR APPELLATE SETTLEMENT PROGRAM 
 
 
 The following guidelines for participation in  appellate settlement procedures do not 
constitute rules of court.  They are made for the purpose of providing informal aid to counsel 
interested in participating in settleme nt conferences at the appellate level. 
 1. Settlement efforts will be commenced by filing with the Court of Appeal a written request 
for settlement conference, executed by the parties to a pending appeal .  If the appeal involves more 
than two parties, settlement procedures will be commenced upon the request for any two opposing 
parties.  2. Settlement procedures may be initiated at any time up to 30 days following the filing of final 
briefs.  The procedures may be in itiated prior to the f iling of any briefs, or at any period during the 
briefing period.  The commencement of settlement  procedures will ordinarily not permit the 
interruption or extension of  the brief filing schedule. 
 3. Upon receipt of a stipulated settlement confer ence request, the Presiding Justice will appoint 
a Settlement Justice.  The partie s stipulating to settlem ent procedures may request the appointment 
of a specific justice as Settlement Justice.  Selection of the Settlement Justice shall, however, always be at the discretion of the Presiding Justice.  The Court also reserves the right to decline to 
initiate settlement procedures in any specific case.  4. If a Settlement Justice is appointed who is not presently sitting, any compensation required 
by that person shall be paid by the parties reque sting the settlement procedures.  No such 
appointment requiring compensation shall be made, however, without the agr eement of the parties. 
 
5. Settlement procedures following appointment of a Settlement Justice shall be at the discretion of the Settlement Justice, acting in cons ultation with the parties.  The filing of settlement 
conference briefs may be required, in the discretion of the Settlement Justice,  if the conference takes 
place before final briefing of the case for appellate review.  The Settlement Justice may, and usually 
will, require the attendance at settlement confer ences of parties or their authorized agents. 
 6. The form on the reverse may be utilized for the initiation of settlement procedures, but is not 
a mandatory form.

  2   2. In an ordinary civil case, the appellant has 40 days from the date the 
record, or the reporter 's transcript after a rule 8. 124 election, is filed 
in the Court of Appeal to file an opening brief.  (Rule 
8.212(a)(1)(A).)  The a ppellant has 70 days to do so after the filing 
of the rule 8.124 election where the appeal proceeds without the 
reporter’ s transcript.  (Rule 8.212(a)(1)( B).)  In a juvenile 
dependency case , the appellant has 30 days to file an opening brief.  
(Rule 8.416(e).)  However, in a criminal or juvenile delinquency 
case, the appellant has 40 days from the filing of the record to file an 
opening brief.  (Rules 8.360(c)(1), 8.412(b)(1).) 
 
  3. The r espondent has 30 days from the date the appellant 's opening 
brief is filed to file a  respondent ’s brief.  (Rules 8.212(a)(2), 
8.360(c)(2), 8.412(b)(2).)   If the respondent in a civil case has not 
already done so, it will be  required to pay a filing fee of $390 or 
obtain a waiver of the requirement from the court at the time the 
brief is filed.  (Rule 8.25(c).)   
   4. The brief of a non- appealing minor in a dependency appeal is due 10 
days after the filing of the respondent 's brief.  (Rule 8.412(b)(4).)  
   5. The a ppellant has 20 days from the date the respondent ’s brief is 
filed to file an appellant' s reply brief.  (Rules 8.212(a)(3), 
8.360(c)(3), 8.412(b)(3).)   
 
  6. For civil and juvenile appeals where a party is both an appellant and 
a respondent, the parties must submit a proposed briefing schedule 
(preferably by agreement) within 20 days after the second notice of 
appeal is filed.  (Rule s 8.216(a) , 8.412(a)(2) .)  For criminal appeals, 
the defendant files the first openi ng brief unless the court orders 
otherwise.  (Rule 8.360(e).)  (See also § I.G below for special 
requirements regarding the format of briefs.)      
 
 B. Extensions of Time to File Briefs  
 
  1. Civil cases 
 
   a. By stipulation .  Except as otherwise provide d by statute, t he 
parties may extend the time under rule 8.212(a) to file a brief 
by up to 60 days by filing one or more stipulations in the 
Court of Appeal before the brief is due .  Stipulation s must 
be signed by and served on all parties  and counsel must  
deliver a copy of the stipulation to his or her client .  (Rule s 
8.60(f )(1), 8.212(b)(1) .)  If filing in paper, t he original 
signature of at least one party must appear on the stipulation filed with the court, while the signatures of the other parties 
may be in the form of copies of the signed signature page of 
the stipulation.  (Rule 8.42.)  If filing electronically, the party 
filing the document must comply with the p rocedures set 
forth in Rule 8.75(c) regarding signatures.  A  stipulation to 3 extend the ti me to file a brief is effective on filing, as the 
Court of Appeal may not shorten a stipulated extension if the 
aggregate of extensions is 60 days or less. (Rule 8.212(b)(2).)  
 
   b. By application .  Where a party has been unable to obtain, or it 
would have been futile to seek, an extension by stipulation or the parties have stipulated to the maximum extension  allowed  
under rule 8.212(b)(1), that party may apply to the P residing 
Justice for an extension on a showing that such is the case and 
there is good c ause.  (Rule 8.212(b)(3); see also rules 8.50, 
8.60(b), 8.63(a)(3).)  The request must contain specific facts showing good cause for granting the application and state when the brief is due, how long an extension is requested, and 
whether any prior extensi ons have been granted, their length 
and whether granted by stipulation or by the court.  (Rules 
8.50,  8.60(c),  8.63(b).)  In determining good cause, the 
reviewing court considers the factors listed in rule 8.63(b).  
 
  2.   Criminal and juvenile delinquency cases  
 
   a. The time for filing a brief in a criminal case cannot be 
extended by stipulation of the parties.  (Rule 8.360(c)(4).)  
    b. A party may apply to the presiding justice for an extension on a showing of good cause.  (Rules 8.50, 8.60(b), 8.63(a )(3), 
8.360(c)(4), 8.412(c).)  The request must contain specific facts showing good cause for granting the application and 
state when the brief is due, how long an extension is 
requested, and whether any prior extensions have been 
granted and their length.   (Rules 8.50, 8.60(c), 8.63(b).)  In 
determining good cause, the reviewing court considers the 
factors listed in rule 8.63(b).  
 
  3. Other juvenile cases : Under rule 8.416(f) in appeals from judgments 
and appealable orders under Welfare and Institutions C ode section 
300 et seq. (dependency) and Family Code section 7800 et seq. 
(freeing a child from parental custody and control), only the 
reviewing court can grant extensions to serve and file briefs , based 
on an exceptional showing of good cause.  (See Code  Civ. Proc., § 
45.) 
 
  4. Service and filing r equirements .  A party must file the request for an 
extension with proof of service on opposing counsel (Rules 
8.44(b)(4) , 8.50, 8.60(c).)  In an ordinary civil case, the client must 
also be served with any exte nsion request ; however, t he evidence of 
mailing or other delivery need not state the client's address.  (Rule 
8.60(f).)   
 4   5. Decis ion.  All requests to extend time to file briefs are considered 
immediately.  (Ct. App. Fourth Dist., Div. One,  Internal Op erating 
Practices &  Proc., XI,  Motions.)  
 
 C. Failure to Timely File a Brief   
 
  1. Court notice .  If an appellant’s opening brief or a respondent’s brief 
is not timely filed, the court will send a notice under rule 8.220(a) 
(civil cases), rule 8.360(c)(5)  (criminal cases), rule 8.412(d) 
(juvenile delinquency cases), or rule 8.416(g) (juvenile dependency 
cases).  This notice gives a party in a civil or juvenile dependency 
case an additional 15 days (rules 8.220(a), 8.416(g)), and a party in a criminal or ju venile delinquency case an additional 30 days (rules 
8.360(c)(5), 8.412(d)(1)), within which to file the brief.  
 
  2. Failure to file  in an ordinary civil or a criminal case .  If the 
appellant’s opening brief is not filed within 15 days in an ordinary 
civil case from the date of the rule 8.220(a) notice, the appeal may 
be dismissed.  (Rule 8.220(a)(1) & (c).)  If the appellant’s opening 
brief is not filed within 30 days in a criminal or juvenile delinquency 
case, the appeal may be dismissed if the appellant  is the People or is 
the defendant and is not represented by appointed counsel.  (Rules 
8.360(c)(5)(A)(i), (iii) & (6), 8.412(d)(1)(A)(i), (iii).)  If the 
appellant is the defendant and is represented by appointed counsel on appeal, the court may relieve t hat appointed counsel and appoint 
new counsel.  (Rules 8.360(c)(5)(A)(ii) & (6), 8.412(d)(1)(A)(ii).)  If the respondent’s brief is not filed before the expiration of the time 
specified in the notice, the court may decide the appeal on the 
record, the opening brief, and any oral argument by the appellant.  
(Rules 8.220(a)(2) & (c), 8.360(c)(5)(B) & (6), 8.412(d)(1)(B).) 
 
  3. Failure to file in certain dependency cases .  If a party fails to timely 
file an appellant's opening brief i n a juvenile dependency a ppeal in 
Orange, Imperial or  San Diego Count y or in an appeal from a 
termination  of parental rights, the court may dismiss the appeal 
where the appellant is either the county or a  party not represented by 
appointed counsel.  (Rules 8.412(d)(1)(A)  (i), (iii) & (2), 8.416(g).)  
If the appellant is other than the county and is represented by 
appointed counsel on appeal, the court will relieve that appointed

requirement ).  (Rule s 8.204(a)(1)(B), 8.208(d)(1) .)  An 
appellant's opening brief must also (i) state the type of case, 
the relief sought in the superior court and the decision being 
appealed, (ii) state why the decision is appealable, and (iii) 
summarize the significant facts, limited to those matters

   b.  Citations to the record .  All references to the record must be 
supported by citations to specific volume and page numbers 
of the record.  (Rule 8.204(a)(1)(C).) 
 
   c. Citation to authority .  Citations to authority must follow the  
California Style Manual  (strongly preferred) or the Bluebook: 
A Uniform System of Citation  and be consistent throughout 
the brief.  (Rule s 8.204(b)(3), 1.200.)  
 
   d. Attachments .  Briefs may include attachments of no more 
than 10 pages of exhibits, othe r matters in the record, 
regulations or other citable materials that are not readily 
accessible.  (Rule 8.204(d).)

 briefs are set forth  in rule 8.204(b).    
 
   b. If filing electronically . The mandatory rules governing  format 
are set forth in rule 8.74.  7  
    
 
  3. Length.   A brief produced on a computer must not exceed 14,000 
words, including footnotes, and must include a certification by 
counsel or an unrepresented party as to the number of words in the 
brief.  (Rule 8.204(c)(1).)  A brief produced on a typewriter must not 
exceed 50 pages.  (Rule 8.204(c)(2).)     
 
  4. File size limitation  (electronic briefs) : 
   The file size limitation for electronically filed documents is 25 
megabytes.  Any document larger than 25 megabytes must be filed in multiple files, each less th an 25 megabytes.   (Rule 8.74(a )(5).) 
 
G. Special requirements for cases involving multiple or cross -appeals . In such

must not exceed twice the word or page limits that would otherwise apply 
(see § I.F.3, above).   Rule 8.204(c)(4).)     
   
II. Certificate of Interested Entities or Persons  
 
 A. When Required.  In appeals in civil cases other than family, juvenile, 
guardianship, and conservatorship cases, each party is required to file a 
certificate of interested entities or persons.  (Rule 8.208(b).)     
 
 B. Purpose.   The certificate provides justices of the C ourt of Appeal with 
additional information to help them determine whether they must disqualify themselves from a particular proceeding pursuant to the California Code of 
Judicial Ethics.  (Rule 8.208(a).)   
 
 C. Contents  of Certificate .  If an entity is a party, that party’s certificate must 
list any other entity or person that the party knows has an ownership 
interest of 10 percent or more in it.  (Rule 8.208(e)(1).)  If a party knows of 
any person or entity, other than the parties themselves, that has a f inancial 
or other interest in the outcome of the proceeding that the party reasonably 
believes the justices should consider in determining whether to disqualify 
themselves, the party’s certificate must list that entity or person and identify 
the nature of the interest of the person or entity.  (Rule 8.208(e)(2).)  An 
optional version of the certificate is available at 
https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/app008.pdf  The certificate must be 
signed by appellate counsel or, if none, by the unrepresented party.  
 
 D. When to File.  Except as otherwise provided in rule 8.208, if a party files a 
motion, an application, or an opposition to such motion or application in the 
Court of Appeal before filing its principal brief, the party must serve and 
file its certificate at the time it files the first such motion, application, or 
opposition and must also include a copy of this certificate in the party ’s 
principal brief.  If no motion, application, or opposition to such motion or 8 application is filed before the parties file their principal briefs, each party 
must include its certificate in its principal brief after the cover and before 
the tables.  (Rule 8.208(d)(1).)   
 
 E. Filing Certificate under Seal.  If the identity of any party or any entity or 
person subject to dis closure under rule 8.208 has not been publicly 
disclosed in the proceedings and a party wants to keep that identity confidential, the party may serve and file an application for permission to 
file its certificate under seal separately from its principal br ief, motion, 
application, or opposition.  If the application is granted, the party must file 
the certificate under seal , but without servi ng it,  within 10 days of the 
court ’s order granting the application.  (Rule 8.208(d)(1) & (2).)  
  
 F. Consequences of F ailure to File .  If a party fails to file a certificate, the 
clerk must notify the party by mail that the party must file the certificate 
within 15 days after the clerk’ s notice is mailed and that if the party fails to 
comply, the court may strike the doc ument or dismiss the appeal if the party 
is the appellant, or strike the document or decide the appeal on the record, 
the opening brief, and any oral argument by the appellant if the party is the respondent.  (Rule 8.208(d)(3).)  
 
 G. Obligation to Update.   A party must promptly serve and file a supplemental 
certificate in the reviewing court upon learning of changed or additional information that must be disclosed under rule 8.208(e).  (Rule 8.208(f).)  
 
III. Motions   
 
 A. Requirements .  A party making a mot ion in the Court of Appeal must file 
the motion and show proof of service on opposing counsel  and, if the 
motion requests an extension of time to designate the record or to pay the 
court reporter , on the clerk of the superior court .  (Rules 8.54(a), 
8.44(b)(4).)  The motion must state the ground for the motion, the papers on 
which it is based, and the order or relief requested.  (Rule 8.54(a)(1).)  
Additionally, it must be accompanied by a memorandum and, if it is based 
on matters not included in the appell ate record,  the supporting documentary 
evidence (declarations and exhibits) of such matters.  (Rule 8.54(a)(2).)     
 
 B. Opposition.  The court will hold a motion for 15 days after filing and a ny 
opposition there to must be served and filed within that 15-day period.  
(Rule 8.54(a)(3).)  The f ailure of the adverse party to oppose the motion 
may be deemed as consent to the granting of the motion. (Rule 8.54(c).)  
 
 C. Certificate of Interested Entities or Persons .  If a motion or opposition is the 
first docum ent filed by a party in the appea l, it must be accompanied by a 
certificate of interested entities or persons  (as discussed in § II., above ). 
  
 9 IV. Voluntary Abandonment, Settlement and Dismissal  
 
 A. Civil Appeals  
 
  1. Settlement.  The court has a voluntary settlement program, which is 
described at  https://www.courts.ca.gov/2519.htm#settle . The 
guidelines and form for initiating a voluntary conference are 
attached.  (Ct. App., Fourth Dist., Div.  One, Internal Operating 
Practices & Proc.,  § VIII.)   
 
   a. Notice  to the Court of Appeal .  If a civil case settles after a 
notice of appeal has been filed, either in its entirety  or as to 
any party, the settling appellant must immediately serve and 
file a notice of settlement in the Court of Appeal. If the case 
settles after the appellant receives a notice setting oral argument, the appellant must immediately notify the Court of 
Appeal of the settlement by telephone or another expeditious 
method.  (Rule 8.244(a)(2).)  
  
   b. Notice to the superior court .  Where the parties have 
designated a clerk ’s or a reporter’ s transcript and the record 
has not been filed in the Court of Appeal, the settling 
appellant must also immediately serve a copy of the notice on 
the superior court clerk.  (Rule 8.244(a)(1).)  
 
   c. Requirement for abandonment or request for dismissal .  
Within 45 days after filing notice of settlement (unless 
otherwise ordered by the Court of Appeal), the settling 
appellant must file an abandonment of the appeal  in the 
superior court , if the record has not yet been filed in the Court 
of Appeal , or a request to dismiss  the appeal,  if the record has 
been filed in the Court of Appeal.  (Rule 8.244(a)(3).)  If the 
appellant fails to do so and does not file a  letter setting forth  
good cause why the appeal should not be dismissed, the Court 
of Appeal may dismiss the appeal as to that appellant and 
order each side to bear its own costs on appeal.  (Rule 8.244(a)(4).)  
 
  2. Abandonment .   
 
  a. Right to aba ndon.  Before the record is filed on appeal, the 
appellant has the absolute right to abandon the appeal by filing a written abandonment or a stipulation for abandonment with the clerk of the superior court. (Rule 8.244(b)(1).)  
 
b. Stipulation or motion to dismiss .  After the record is filed, an 
abandonment of an appeal or a stipulation of the parties to 
dismiss the appeal must be filed in the Court of Appeal (rule 
8.244(c)(1)), which may order the dismissal and immediate 
issuance of the remittitur (rule 8.2 44(c)(2)).  10  
 B. Criminal and Juvenile Appeals   
 
An appellant in a non- death penalty criminal case or in a juvenile case  may 
abandon his/her appeal at any time.  (Rule s 8.316(a) , 8.411(a).)  If the 
record has not been filed, the written abandonment must be filed with the 
clerk of the superior court and operates to dismiss the appeal and to restore 
the jurisdiction of the superior court.  (Rule s 8.316(b)(1) , 8.411(b)(1) .)  If 
the record has been filed, the abandonment must be  filed with the Court of 
Appeal, w hich may order the dismissal and immediate issuance of the 
remittitur.  (Rule s 8.316(b)(2) , 8.411(b)(2) .) 
 
V. Substitution or Withdrawal of Attorneys  
 
 A. Substitution .  A substitution of counsel must be signed by the party to the 
appeal and the new attorney.  (Rule 8.36(b).)  The substitution of an 
attorney must be served and filed in the Court of Appeal.  (Rules 
8.44(b)(6), 8.36(b).)  A file -stamped copy of a substitution filed in the 
superior court does not effect a substitution of counsel in the Court of 
Appeal.  In all appeals and in original proceedings related to a superior 
court proceeding, the party must also serve the superior court.  (Rule 8.36(b).)    
 
 B. Withdrawal .  An attorney may request withdrawal by filing a motion to do 
so.  Unless the court orders otherwise, the motion need be served only on 
the party represented and the attorneys directly affected.  (Rule 8.36(c)(1).)  The proof of service need not include the address of the represented party.  
However, if the motion is granted, the withdrawing attorney must provide the court and the opposing party with the party’ s current or last known 
address and telephone number.  (Rule 8.36(c)(2).)  
 
 C. Notification .  In all appeals and in original proceedings related to a superior 
court proceeding, the Court of Appeal will forward notice of a substitution or withdrawal to the clerk of the superior court.  (Rule 8.36(c)(3).)  
 
VI. Oral Argument  
 
 A. Notice .  Once the respondent's  brief is filed or the time for doing so has 
expired, the clerk will send a notice inquiring whether the parties desire  oral 
argument.  
 
 B. Requesting or Waiving Oral Argument .  Parties desiring oral argument 
must respond within l0 days of the date of the notice.  If no response is received within the time specified, oral argument will be  deemed waived.  
 
 C. Time Allowed for Argument .  Argument will be limited to no more than 
fifteen minutes per side  unless additional time is granted by leave of court 
upon a party's advance written request.  (Rules 8.256(c), 8.366(a), 8.470; Misc.  Order No. 021505 (Feb. 15, 2005); Ct. App., Fourth Dist., Div. One, 
Internal Operating Practices & Proc., § VII, Oral Argument.) 11  
D. Date and Time for Argument .  If oral argument is requested, the parties will 
be notified of the date and time approximatel y 30 days before the date 
scheduled for oral argument.  Oral argument is generally held during the 
second full week of the month, although a case may be calendared during 
other times when resolution of the matter is urgent or for other good cause.   
 
VII. Decision in the Court of Appeal  
 
A. Opinion.   Unless disposed of by an order or other action, an appeal is 
decided by an opinion of the court, with written reasons for the decision.  
At two least justices must agree on the result.  (Cal. Const. , art. VI, §  3.) 
 
B. Finality .  The Court of Appeal has power to grant rehearing, publish or 
modify a n opinion or otherwise act in the case until it becomes final.  
 
1. Finality generally .  Except in certain circumstances (for example, 
section 2 below), the opinion bec omes final in 30 days.  (Rule 
8.264(b).)  Some decisions may become final at other times under 
the Rules of Court or by special order of the court.  For example, 
dismissals of appeals on request or stipulation become final 
immediately, as do summary denials of writ petitions.  (Rules 
8.264(b)(2), 8.490(b)(1).)  
  
2. Events that extend finality .  If the court orders the opinion published 
after it is filed or modifies it in a way that changes the judgment, the 
opinion becomes final 30 days after the order publ ishing or 
modifying the opinion is filed.  (Rule 8.264(b)(3), (c)(2).)  A 
modification order will state whether there is a change in the 
judgment.  (Rule 8.264(c)(2).)  
 
VIII. Rehearing  
 
A. Jurisdiction .  The Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to consider and order 
rehearing of a case until the decision becomes final, as described in section 
VII. above.  
 
B. Necessity of Requesting Rehearing.  The filing of a petition for rehearing is 
crucial if a party believes that the Court of Appeal decision has misstated o r 
omitted an important fact or point of law and intends to seek review in the California Supreme Court relating to that fact or point of law; absent the 
filing of a petition, the California Supreme Court's policy is to accept the 
Court of Appeal's statemen t of the issues and recitation of the facts.  (Rule 
8.500(c)(2).)    
 
 C. Filing and S ervice.   A petition for rehearing may be served and filed within 
l5 days after the filing of (i) the opinion, (ii) a publication order restarting 
the finality period under  8.264(b)(3) (if the party has not already filed a 
rehearing petition), (iii) a modification order changing the appellate 12 judgment under rule 8.264(c)(2) , or (iv) the filing of a consent under 
8.264(d).  (Rule s 8.268(b)  (1)(A)- (D), 8.366(a), 8.470; see rul e 8.25).)    
 
 D. Answer to Petition .  An answer to a petition for rehearing cannot be filed 
unless the court requests one.  If an answer is requested, it must be served 
and filed within 8 days after the order requesting it is filed , unless the court 
orders  otherwise .  (Rule 8.40(b).)   A petition for rehearing normally will 
not be granted unless the court has requested an answer.  (Rule 8.268(b)(2); see rule 8.25.)  
 
IX.  Review by the California Supreme Court  
 
 A. Time for Requesting.  A  party may ask the Ca lifornia Supreme Court to 
review a decision of the Court of  Appeal by serving and filing  a petition for 
review within 10 days after the Court of Appeal decision becomes  final in 
that court.  (Rule 8.500(a) & (e)(1); see rule s 8.264(b) , 8.366(a), 8.470.)   
Guidance on petitions for review is available at  http://www.courts.ca.gov/  
2962.htm.   
 
 B. Requirements .  Rules 8.40(b), 8.500 and 8.504 describe the requirements 
for petitions for review, answers thereto and reply briefs . 
 
 C. Applicable Procedures .  Rule s 8.512 through 8.544 describe the procedures 
for granting or denying review and the procedures that apply if review is 
granted.  For further information concerning Supreme Court procedures, 
consult the rules or call (4l5) 865- 7000 (San Francisco).  
 
X. Rem ittitur  - [Rule 8.272]  
 
 A. What the Remittitur Do es.  A remittitur is the document that communicates 
a final determination by the reviewing court to the superior  court,  and 
transfers  jurisdiction over the case back to the superior  court where the case 
originated so as to permit that court to proceed in accordance with the 
decision on appeal.  
 
 B. When It Issues .  Absent a petition for review and any extension to the time 
period for the Supreme Court to grant review on its own motion, a 
remittitur will issue 31 days after the Court of Appeal decision is final.  If a 
petition for review is filed  or the Supreme Court extends the time to grant 
review on its own motion, a remittitur will issue when the case becomes 
final as to the Supreme Court.  (See rules 8.272,  8.366(a), 8.470, 8.512(c) , 
8.532.)   
 
XI. Costs on Appeal in Civil Cases  
 
 A. Entitlement to Costs on A ppeal .  Unless the Court of Appeal orders 
otherwise, under rule 8.278(a) the prevailing party in the appeal is entitled to costs on appeal.  Rule 8.278(a)(1)- (3) defines "" prevailing party. "" 
 13  B. Court of Appeal Decision.   The Court of Appeal may award or deny costs 
in the interests of justice.  The court will specify the award of costs if the 
judgment is reversed or modified in part.  (Rule 8.278(a)(3) &  (5).) 
 
C. Applicable Procedures  for Claiming or Opposing Costs  (Rules 8.278(c), 
3.1700) :  A party claiming costs awarded by the Court of Appeal must file 
a verified memorandum  of recoverable costs in the superior court within 40 
days after the remittitur issues (see section XIV above).  (Rule 8.278(c)(1) .)  
Rule 8.278(d) defines the items that are recoverable as costs on appeal.",

The following information has been prepared to assist counsel in avoiding 
common mistakes in processing an appeal .1 This is NOT AN OFFICIAL COURT 
DOCUMENT and is not intended to be relied upon as a substitute for the relevant  statutes  
and rules. The purpose of this document is t o serve as a reference to important statutes 
and rules that might affect an appeal to which you are a party. It is not designed as an 
exhaustive treatment of the subjects touched upon.

I. TAKING AN  APPEAL  
A. The Need for an Appealable Order or Judgment : Appeal remedies are 
statutory; only certain orders or judgments may be appealed. Before filing 
a notice of appeal, it is important to ascertain whether the appeal is being 
taken from an appealable order or judgment. (See, e.g., Code Civ.  Proc.,  
§ 904.1; other statutes make other orders directly appealable.)  If an order 
or judgment is not immediately appealable, it may nonetheless be subject  to 
review by a petition for a writ of  mandate.  
 
 
 
1 This informational handout provides a non -exhaustive summary of the appellate procedures for 
taking an appeal and perfecting the record in civil appeals in the California Court of Appeal, 
Fourth Appellate District, Division One. Please consult the Californ ia Rules of Court to process 
your appeal properly. Information relating to procedures after an appeal is filed and the record 
has been prepared is available https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/basic_app_proc.pdf .  2  B. The Notice of Appeal  (Rule  8.100(a)):  
 
1. Content of the notice of appeal : Although no particular format is 
required for a notice of appeal, the Judicial Council has a form 
(APP -002, which can be found at http://www.courts.ca.gov/  
forms.htm?filter=APP) that may be used. Judicial Council Form 
APP-001 provides guidance for filling out the form  notice.  
 
At a minimum, the notice of appeal should identify the judgment  or 
order being appealed and include the name of the appellant, the court 
where the proceedings took place, the case number, and similar 
relevant information. (Rule 8.100(a)(2).) The notice of appeal must 
be signed by the appellant or the appellant's attor ney. (Rule 
8.100(a)(1).)  
2. Filing the notice of appeal  (Rules 8.104,  8.108):  
 
a. Time to file : The time in which to file a notice of appeal is 
set by rule and is jurisdictional . Except as provided in  rule 
8.66 (which extends the time for filing due to public 
emergency), the Court of Appeal has no power to relieve a 
party from a failure to comply with rules 8.104 and 8.108 and 
must dismiss an appeal that is untimely thereunder. (Rules 
8.104(b), 8.60(d).)  
 
Normally, the time for filing a notice of appeal is the shorter  
of: (1) 60 days after the superior court clerk serves the party 
filing the notice of appeal with notice of entry of judgment or 
a file -stamped copy of the judgment, showing the date either 
was s erved; (2) 60 days after service of notice of entry of 
judgment or appealable order; or (3) 180 days after entry of 
the judgment or appealable order. (Rule 8.104(a)(1).) 
However, many circumstances can complicate this formula.  
 
The appellant should careful ly review rules 8.104 and 8.108 
and case law to assure that the notice of appeal is timely.  
Rule 8.108 operates to extend (but will not shorten) the time 
to appeal otherwise prescribed in rule 8.104(a)(1) under 
certain circumstances; thus, if the normal ti me to appeal 
stated in rule 8.104(a)(1) is longer than the time provided in 
rule 8.108, the time to appeal stated in rule 8.104(a)(1) 
governs. (Rule 8.108(a).)  
 
b. Place to file : The appeals section of the superior court is 
responsible for processing the n otice of appeal; thus, the 
notice of appeal should be filed in the superior court that 
rendered the judgment or order from which the appeal is 
being taken. (Rule 8.100(a).) Notices of appeal from the San 
Diego Superior Court's Central, East County and  South 3  County Divisions should be filed with the appeals section of 
the downtown superior court facility, while notices of appeal 
from the North County Division must be filed in that court, 
which is in Vista. Notices of appeal and other relevant 
appellate pleadin gs for Imperial County cases should be filed 
for processing in the superior court in El Centro. The 
complete addresses and telephone numbers for these courts 
appear in section VII., below.  
3. Service of the notice of appeal  (Rule 8.100(a)(1)):  
 
The appella nt or the appellant's attorney must sign the notice and 
serve it on the other parties. (Rules 8.100(a)(1), 8.25(a)(1).) A 
failure to serve the notice of appeal does not prevent its filing or 
affect its validity, although the court may require the appellant  to 
remedy the failure. (Rule 8.100(a)(3).) The superior court clerk 
gives notice of the filing to the parties and the reviewing court. 
(Rule 8.100(e)(1) -(3)). If a notice of appeal is combined with a 
designation of the clerk's transcript, an election to p roceed by 
appendix, and/or a designation of the reporter’s transcript, any 
designation or election also must be served on all parties. (Rules 
8.121(a), 8.25(a)(1); see generally rules 8.120, 8.122, 8.124 &  
8.130.)  
 
C. Required Filing Fee  (Rule 8.100(b), (c)): A notice of appeal delivered to 
the superior court must be accompanied by a $775 filing fee, payable by 
check or money order made to the ""Clerk, Court of Appeal"". (Rule 
8.100(b)(1).) If the appellant is indigent, payment of the filin g fee may be 
excused upon application under rule 8.26. (Rule 8.100(b)(2).) Information 
regarding the fee waiver process can be found at http://www.courts.ca.gov/  
app015info.pdf. The appellant's failure to either pay the filing fee or obtain 
a waiver of the fee may result in the dismissal of the appeal. (Rule 8.100(c) 
& (d).) 
 
D. Deposit for the Clerk's Transcript  (Gov. C ode, § 68926.1): Subject to the 
exception described below, at the time the notice of appeal is filed, the 
appellant must also make a $100 non-refundable deposit (made by separate 
check payable to the ""Clerk of the Superior Court""). (Rule 8.100(b)(2).) 
The deposit is not required for appeals from the San Diego County  Superior  
Court, however, if the notice of appeal contains an election to proceed by 
appendix under rule 8.124. 2 When the deposit is required, the appellant's 
failure to pay it may result in the dismissal of the appeal. (Rule 8.100(d).)  
II. THE RECORD ON  APPEAL  
 
A. Normal Record on Appeal  (Rule 8.120): The appeals section of the 
superior court is responsible for processing the notice of appeal,  preparing  
 
2 Other counties may still require this  fee. 4  the record on appeal  and certifying the record to the Court of Appeal. 
However, the appellant bears the burden of designating a record that the 
court will need to review to resolve the issues the appellant plans to raise. 
(Gee v. American Realty & Construction, Inc. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1412, 
1416 [an appellant has the burden of overcoming the appellate  presumption 
that the challenged judgment or order is correct and providing an adequate 
record to demonstrate the alleged errors].) The normal record on appeal in 
a civil case g enerally contains the record of the written documents and the 
oral proceedings. (Rule  8.120.)  
 
1. Written documents : A record of the written documents may be in 
the form of a clerk's transcript (see rule 8.122), an appendix (see  rule 
8.124), the original s uperior court file (only where the parties so 
stipulate and unless the Court of Appeal orders otherwise for the 
particular case) (see rule 8.128), an agreed statement (see rule 
8.134(a)(2)), or a settled statement (see rule 8.137). (Rule 
8.120(a)(1).) If t he appellant intends to raise any issue requiring 
consideration of the record of an administrative proceeding that was 
admitted in evidence, refused, or lodged in the superior court, the 
record on appeal must include that administrative record. (Rule 
8.120 (a)(2).)  
 
2. Oral proceedings : If the appellant intends to raise any issue 
requiring consideration of the testimony and other oral proceedings 
in the superior court, the record on appeal should include a record  of 
these proceedings in the form of a reporte r's transcript (see rule 
8.130), an agreed statement (see rule 8.134), or a settled statement 
(see rule 8.137). (Rule 8.120(b).) The failure to include a record of 
the oral proceedings in the designation of the record may effectively 
prevent the court from  entertaining certain challenges the appellant 
attempts to raise. (E.g., Estate of Fain (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 973, 
992 [without a record of the relevant oral proceedings, the appellant 
may not be able to meet its burden on appeal to establish that the 
evidence was insufficient to support the judgment or  order].)  
B. Appellant's Designation of the Record on  Appeal : 
1. Time to file the designation:  Within 10 days of filing the notice of 
appeal, the appellant must serve on the parties and file in the 
superior court a notice designating the record on appeal. (Rule 
8.121(a).) The notice designating the record may be combined  with 
the notice of appeal. (Rule 8.121(a).) It must specify the date the 
notice of appeal was filed. (Rule  8.121(b)(2).)  
 
2. Specifying the form of the written documents : The notice 
designating the record must specify the form of the record of the 
written documents the appellant is electing to use (see § II.A.  above 
for a description of the options). If the appellant is electing to use a 
clerk's transcript, the notice must designate the documents  required  5  to be included in the clerk' s transcript under rule 8.122(b)(1) and any 
administrative record that needs to be transmitted to the reviewing 
court under rule 8.123 (rule 8.121(b)(2)). (See § II.C., below.)  
 
3. Specifying the form of the oral proceedings, if desired : The notice 
must al so specify whether the appellant is electing to proceed with  or 
without a record of the trial court oral proceedings. If the appellant 
intends to include a record of the trial court oral proceedings, the 
notice must specify which form of the record listed in rule 8.120(b) 
the appellant elects to use (again see § II.A. above). If the appellant 
is electing to use a reporter's transcript , the notice must designate 
the proceedings to be included in the transcript.  (Rule 8.130(a).) 
(See § II.D.,  below.)  
C. Designating the Contents of the Clerk's Transcript  (Rule  8.122):  
1. Content of the designation : Pursuant to rule 8.122(a)(1) and local 
superior court practice, a party requesting a clerk's transcript under 
rule 8.121 must list each requested document by title,  accurate 
description and date of filing with the superior court. A designation 
that fails to provide these details will be returned, which may cause a 
default under rule 8.140(a). A designation may specify that portions 
of identified documents (e.g., spec ific pages or exhibits that are 
duplicated elsewhere in the record) be omitted from the record. 
(Rule  8.122(a)(1).)  
 
2. Respondent's designation : Within 10 days after service of the 
appellant's notice of designation of the clerk's transcript, the 
respondent may serve and file a notice in superior court designating 
any additional documents the respondent wants included in the 
transcript. (Rule  8.122(a)(2).)  
 
3. Content of the clerk's transcript : The required and permissible 
contents of a clerk's transcript are listed in rule  8.122(b).  
 
D. Designating the Reporter's Transcript and Making the Required  Deposit  
(Rule  8.130):  
 
1. Content of the designation : If the appellant's notice designating the 
record on appeal elects to use a reporter's transcript, it must specify 
the date of each proceeding to be included in the transcript; it may 
also identify portions of designated proceedi ngs that are not to be 
included. (Rule 8.130(a)(1).) The notice must identify any 
proceeding for which a certified transcript has been prepared. (Rule 
8.130(a)(1).) Local superior court practice requires that the notice 
also set forth the name of the court  reporter, the number of the 
department in which the proceedings took place and the nature of  the 
proceedings reported. If the designation does not specify  the 6  proceeding by date, it will be returned, which may cause a default. 
(Rule 8.140(a), (b).)  
 
If less than all of the testimony is designated for inclusion in the 
record , the notice must specify the points to be raised on appeal. 
(Rule 8.130(a)(2).) In that circumstance, the appeal will be limited 
to those points unless, on motion, the reviewing court permits 
otherwise. (Rule 8.130(a)(2).) A party cannot exclude portions of a 
witness's testimony unless the parties so stipulate. (Rule 
8.130(e)(2).)  
 
2. Service of the designation and required deposit :  Except when a 
party submits a certified transcript that contains all the designated 
proceedings under rule 8.130(b)(3)(C), a ny notice of designation 
must be served on each known reporter of the relevant proceedings. 
(Rule 8.130(a)(5).) Except as provided below, the designation must 
be accompanied by a $50 deposit to the superior court and a deposit 
of the approximate cost of th e transcript (as estimated by the reporter 
in writing or in the amount of $325 for proceedings of three hours or 
less or $650 per day for proceedings of over three hours) and a 
notice of deposit. (Rule 8.130(b)(1)(B)(i).) For proceedings that 
have previous ly been transcribed: $80 per fraction of the day's 
proceeding that did not exceed three hours, or $160 per day or 
fraction that exceeded three hours. (Rule 8.130(b)(1)(B)(ii).) In lieu 
of a deposit, a party may substitute a reporter's written waiver of the  
deposit, a copy of a Transcript Reimbursement Fund application 
filed under rule 8.130(c)(1), or a certified transcript of the designated 
proceedings. (Rule 8.130(b)(3).) Where the reporter waives the 
deposit for, and the party provides a certified transcr ipt of, a part of 
the designated proceedings, the waiver or transcript replaces the 
deposit for only that part of the proceedings. (Rule  8.130(b)(3).)  
 
3. Respondent's designation and deposit : Within 10 days of service of 
the appellant's notice designating  a reporter's transcript, the 
respondent may designate any additional oral proceedings to be 
included in the transcript. (Rule 8.130(a)(3).) If the respondent 
orders transcripts not ordered by the appellant, the respondent must 
deposit the approximate cost  of preparing those additional portions 
of the transcript. (Rule 8.130(b)(1),  (3).) 
 
4. Reviewing court order for a transcript of oral proceedings : If the 
appellant does not order a transcript of any oral proceeding, the 
respondent cannot order a transcrip t. However, the reviewing court, 
on its own motion or on motion by the respondent, may order the 
record augmented to include the reporter's transcript to prevent a 
miscarriage of justice. Unless the court otherwise orders, the 
appellant is responsible for the cost of any reporter's transcript it 
orders to augment the record. (Rule  8.130(a)(4).)  7  5. Transcripts in computer -readable format on request : On request, the 
reporter must provide any party with a copy of the reporter's 
transcri pt in a computer -readable format, unless the superior court 
orders otherwise. (Rule 8.130(f)(4).) Costs and procedures are set 
out in Code of Civil Procedure section 269, subdivision (a)(1), and 
Government Code sections 69950 and  69954.  
E. Election to Proc eed by  Appendix : 
 
1. Election by appellant or respondent : If the appellant's notice 
desig nating the record on appeal elects to use an appendix under rule 
8.124, or if within 10 days after the notice of appeal is filed, the 
respondent serves and files a notice in the superior court electing to 
use an appendix and no waiver of the fee for a cler k's transcript is 
granted to the appellant, rule 8.124 governs, unless the superior  court 
orders otherwise on a motion served and filed within 10 days after 
the notice of election is served.  (Rule 8.124(a)(1).)  Documents to 
be included in the appendix ne ed not be enumerated in the  election.  
 
2. Contents of the appendix : The required and permissible contents of 
an appendix are listed in rule 8.124(b). An appendix must not 
include documents or portions thereof that are not necessary for 
proper consideration  of the issues raised in the appeal. (Rule 
8.124(b)(3)(A).) Also, it must not include transcripts of oral 
proceedings that may be made part of the reporter's transcript under 
rule 8.130. (Rule  8.124(b)(3)(B).)  
 
3. Service and filing of the appendix : A join t appendix or an 
appellant's appendix must be served and filed with the appellant's 
opening brief. (Rule 8.124(e)(2).) Any respondent's appendix must 
be served and filed with the respondent's brief and any appellant's 
reply appendix must be served and file d with the appellant's reply 
brief. (Rule 8.124(e)(3),  (4).) 
F. Exhibits, Depositions, and Administrative Proceeding Transcripts : 
 
1. Exhibits are part of the record:  All exhibits (whether admitted, 
refused or lodged) are deemed part of the record on appea l, even 
those that are not designated by the parties for inclusion. (Rules 
8.122(a)(3),  8.124(b)(4).)  
 
2. Exhibits in the clerk's transcript : A party wanting a particular 
exhibit to be included in the clerk's transcript must specify that 
exhibit by number or letter in its notice of designation. If the 
superior court has returned a designated exhibit to a party, the party 
in possession of that exhibit must deliver it to the superior court 
clerk within 10 days after the notice designating the exhibit is 
serve d. (Rule  8.122(a)(3).)  8  3. Including an exhibit held by another party : Rule 8.124(c)  outlines 
the process to be followed by a party preparing an appendix who 
wants it to include an exhibit in the possession of another  party.  
 
4. Designating original exhibits not in the clerk's transcript or 
appendix : A party who wants the Court of Appeal t o consider 
original exhibits that were admitted in evidence, refused or lodged, 
but not copied into the clerk's transcript or an appendix, must serve 
and file a notice in superior court designating such exhibits within  10 
days after the last respondent's b rief is filed or could have been filed 
under rule 8.212. (Rule 8.224(a)(1).) Within 10 days of that notice, 
any other party who wants the Court of Appeal to consider 
additional exhibits must serve and file a like notice in the superior 
court designating su ch exhibits. (Rule 8.224(a)(2).) These 
designation notices must be served on the Court of Appeal. (Rule 
8.224(a)(3).)  
 
Within 20 days of the first designation notice, the superior court 
clerk must send the exhibits it possesses to the Court of Appeal. 
(Rule 8.224(b)(1).) Any party possessing designated exhibits 
returned to it by the superior court must put them into numerical or 
alphabetical order and forward them to the Court of Appeal with two 
copies of the list of exhibits sent. (Rule 8.224(b)(2).)  
 
5. Depositions : Depositions cannot be copied into the clerk's 
transcript, nor can the originals be transmitted by the clerk to the 
Court of Appeal, except by stipulation or order of the reviewing 
court. (Rule 8.122(b)(4)(A).) Portions of depositions read in op en 
court and reported, regardless of whether received into evidence, 
will be included in the reporter's transcript if  designated.  
 
6. Administrative records : Rule 8.123 applies if the record of an 
administrative proceeding was admitted in evidence, refused, or 
lodged in the superior court. (Rule 8.123(a).)  Such an 
administrative proceeding transcript cannot be included in the  clerk's 
transcript but must inst ead be transmitted to or lodged with the 
reviewing court under rule 8.123(c) or (d), unless the reviewing 
court orders or the parties stipulate otherwise.  (Rule 
8.122(b)(4)(B).)  
G. Who Pays the Cost of the  Record : 
 
1. Clerk's transcript : The appellant pays the entire cost of the clerk's 
transcript, even when respondent has designated additional 
documents to be included in the transcript. When the clerk's 
transcript is complete, the appellant receives a copy and the  original 
is forwarded to the Court of Appeal. (Rules 8.122(c)(1), (3), 
8.122(d)(1) & 8.150(a).)  9  2. Reporter's transcript : As discussed above, each party pays for the 
portion of the reporter's transcript that it designates. When the 
transcript is complete , the appellant receives a copy and the  original 
is forwarded to the Court of Appeal. (Rules 8.130(b), (f) & 
8.150(a).)  
 
3. Multiple appeals : If more than one appeal is taken from the same 
judgment or a related order, only one appellate record need be 
prepared. Such record must be filed within the time permitted for 
filing the record in the latest appeal. Unless otherwise agreed by  the 
appellants or ordered by the superior court, separately represented 
appellants equally share the cost of preparing an origi nal record for 
the Court of Appeal and each is entitled to a copy. (Rule 
8.147(a)(1),  (2).) 
 
H. Respondent's Copy of the Record : The respondent does not automatically 
receive a copy of the record but must promptly request a copy of a clerk's 
or reporter's transcript, if desired. The superior court clerk is required to 
give each party notice of the estimated cost to prepare a copy of the  clerk's 
transcript for that party's use. (Rule  8.122(c)(1)(B).)  
 
I. Lending the Record : A party that does not procure its own copy of the 
record may borrow the other party’s copy by notifying the other party  in 
writing not more than 20 days after the record is filed in the Court of 
Appeal. (Rule  8.153(a).)  
III. CORRECTION OF THE RECORD ON  APPEAL  
A. Corrections Made in the Court of Appeal : By the court's own motion, a 
party's motion or a stipulation, the Court of Appeal may order the 
correction or certification of any part of the record. (Rule 8.155(c)(1).) 
Also, it may order the superior court to set tle disputes regarding omissions 
or errors in the record. (Rule 8.155(c)(2).) However, where a clerk or 
reporter omits a required or designated part of the record, a party may  serve 
and file a notice in superior court specifying the omitted material and 
requesting that it be prepared, certified and forwarded to the Court of 
Appeal. The party must serve a copy of that notice on the Court of Appeal. 
(Rule  8.155(b)(1).)  
 
B. Requests to Augment the Record : At any time, the Court of Appeal, on its 
own motion or that of a party, may order the record augmented to include 
any document filed or lodged in the case in the superior court or a certified 
transcript, or an agreed or settled statement, of oral proceedings not 
designated under rule 8.130. (Rule 8.155(a)(1).)  Any party moving to 
augment the record must attach a copy of the matter to be added, unless 
unavailable. The pages of the attachment must be consecutively  numbered, 
beginning with the number one. Where a copy of the matter to be added is 
unavailable, the party must identify it with specificity as required under 
rules 8.122 and 8.130. (Rule 8.155(a)(2), (3).) Unless the court  orders  10  otherwise, the appellant is responsible for the cost of any additional 
transcript the court may order.  (Rule 8.155(a)(1)(B).)  
IV. FILING OF THE RECORD ON APPEAL  
 
A. Certification and Transmittal : Once the record on appeal is complete, the 
superior court clerk certifies the original and transmits it to the Court of 
Appeal. (Rule  8.150(a).)  
 
B. Corrections a fter Certification : After the record is certified, any further 
matters involving the record, except clerk or reporter omissions (see rule 
8.155(b)(1)) and corrections of clerical error, must be filed with the clerk's 
office for the Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District, Division  One.  
 
C. The filing of the record triggers the time for filing opening briefs. 
(Rule  8.212(a).)  
V. CIVIL CASE INFORMATION  STATEMENT  
A. Form of Statement : An appellant or cross -appellant must serve and file in 
the Court of Appeal a Civil Case Information Statement (Judicial Council 
form APP -004) within 15 days after the superior court clerk mails the 
notification of filing of the notice of appeal required by rule 8.100(e)(1). 
(Rule 8.100(g)(1).) A copy of the judgment or appealed order showing the 
date it was entered must be attached to the completed statement. (Rule 
8.100(g)(1).) To comply with this requirement, the court requests that the 
copy of the appe aled judgment or order be signed and dated. The statement 
requires the appealing party to attach a list of all parties and their attorneys 
of record who will participate in the appeal. The filing of the statement is 
required in all civil cases except appea ls from juvenile dependency 
proceedings.  
 
B. Failure to File : If an appealing party fails to timely file a Civil Case 
Information Statement, the Court of Appeal clerk will notify the party by 
mail that the statement must be filed within 15 days after the clerk's  notice 
is mailed and that if the appealing party fail s to comply, the court may 
impose monetary sanctions or dismiss the appeal. (Rule  8.100(g)(2).)  
VI. CERTIFICATE OF INTERESTED ENTITIES OR  PERSONS  
A. Requirement for Certificate : In appeals in civil cases other than family, 
juvenile, guardianship, and conse rvatorship cases, each party is required  to 
file a certificate of interested entities or persons. (Rule 8.208(b).) An 
optional version of the certificate is available at http://www.  
courts.ca.gov/documents/app008.pdf.  
 
1. Purpose : The certificate provides justices of the Court of  Appeal 
with additional information to help them determine whether they 
must disqualify themselves from a particular proceeding  in 11  accordance with the California Code of Judicial Ethics. (Rule 
8.208(a).)  
 
2. Signature : The certificat e must be signed by appellate counsel or,  if 
none, by the unrepresented  party.  
 
B. When to File : Except as otherwise provided in rule 8.208, if a party files a 
motion, an application, or an opposition to such motion or application in  the 
Court of Appeal before filing its principal brief, the party must serve and 
file its certificate at the time it files the first such motion, application, or 
opposition and must include a copy of this certificate in its principal brief. 
If no motion, application, or  opposition to such motion or application is 
filed before the parties file their principal briefs, each party must include its 
certificate in its principal brief after the cover and before the tables. (Rule 
8.208(d)(1).)  
 
C. Filing Certificate under Seal : If the identity of any party has not been 
publicly disclosed in the proceedings, the party may serve and file an 
application for permission to file its certificate under seal rather than as part 
of its principal brief, motion, application, or opposition.  (Rule  8.208(d)(2).)  
 
D. Failure to File :  If a party fails to file a certificate, the clerk must notify it 
by mail that it must file the certificate within 15 days after the clerk's  notice 
is mailed and that if it fails to comply, the court may strike the document or 
dismiss the appeal if the party is the appellant, or strike the document or 
decide the appeal on the record, the opening brief, and any oral argument 
by the appellant if the party is the respondent. (Rule  8.208(d)(3).)  
 
E. Contents of Certificate : If an entity is a party, that party's certificate must 
list any other entity or person that the party knows has an ownership 
interest of 10 percent or more in the party. (Rule 8.208(e)(1).) If a party 
knows of any person or entity,  other than the parties themselves, that has  a 
financial or other interest in the outcome of the proceeding that the party 
reasonably believes the justices should consider in determining whether to 
disqualify themselves, the party's certificate must list t hat entity or person 
and identify the nature of the interest of the person or entity. (Rule 
8.208(e)(2).)  
 
F. Obligation to Update : Upon learning of changed or additional information 
that must be disclosed under rule 8.208(e), a party must promptly serve  and 
file a supplemental certificate in the Court of Appeal. (Rule  8.208(f).)  
 
VII. OBTAINING MORE INFORMATION AND PERTINENT ADDRESSES AND 
TELEPHONE  NUMBERS  
 
A. Court Website : The Court of Appeal maintains a comprehensive Internet 
web site containing case information (except on confidential cases), oral 
argument calendars, opinions (published and unpublished), local rules, 
frequently asked questions, practices and procedures, biog raphies of  the 12  court's justices and information regarding its extern program. The web site 
can be accessed at: http://www.courts.ca.gov/4dca.htm . A copy of a

Cost of the reporter's transcript : Where the appellant has previously deposited the approximate cost of the transcript, the appellant will be billed directly by the reporter for the actual cost of the transcript. If the actual cost exceeds the amount of the deposit, the appellant must pay the additional cost directly to the reporter. (Rule 8.130(b)(1)(C).) If the actual cost is less than the amount of the deposit, the difference will be refunded to the appellant. (Rule 8.130(b)(1)(C).) 7 5. Transcript reimbursement fund : If the appellant is unable to pay the costs of the reporter's transcript, the appellant may apply to the superior court for reimbursement from the Transcript Reimbursement Fund. (Rule 8.130(c)(1).) The court administrator's office in each county administers the fund and processes applications from appellants who cannot afford to pay the cost of the reporter's transcript. (Rule 8.130(c).) The applications are available from the court administrator's office and must be filed in the superior court. (Rule 8."

HANDOUT ON WRITS  
 
Preliminary Note 
 
This handout is intended to assist an attorney  or a  layperson who may be 
contemplating filing or responding to a petition for writ of mandate, writ of prohibition or 
writ of supersedeas.  It does not address petitions for writs of review, petitions for writs 
of habeas corpus or other specialized writ petitions.  
 
The court recognizes writ petitions are frequently prepared i n a hurry  by attorneys or 
parties with limited experience in writ procedure and therefore takes a relatively informal 
approach to processing writ petitions.  For example, t he court will treat your petition as 
having the proper label (e.g., deem it to be a petition for writ of mandate if  you 
mistakenly  prayed for a writ of  prohibition)  and may call you if a critical part of the 
record is missing.  
 
There are, however, certain requirements that are crucial to success  in obtaining writ 
relief .  This handout focuses on th ese requirements.  
 
Prefiling Considerations 
 
A writ is a directive from this court to a trial  court, an administrative agency, or a 
person to do something or to stop doing something.  Unlike appeals, which are heard 
as a matter of right, writ petitions are generally heard as a matter of discretion, and 
they are governed by equitable principles.  Appellate courts generally grant writ 
relief only when the petitioner (1) has no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in 
the ordinary course of law; and (2) will suffer irreparable injury if such relief is not 
granted.  
 If the order, judgment or decision you intend to challenge is directly appealable, you 
are considered to have an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of  law unless you can 
show extraordinary  circumstances  (e.g., a need for immediate relief).  Check Code of 
Civil Procedure section 904.1  to see what orders and judgments are directly appealable; 
for rulings not covered by that section, you may also wish to look at the cases dealing  2 with the ruling in question to see if the issue was resolved by  an appellate opinion or a 
writ opinion.  
 
The irreparable injury requirement is more difficult to define.  It is not established by 
the mere facts that the challenged ruling is wrong and because of it you will have to 
spend time and money on unnecessary further litigation.  Loss of money damages 
generally  also is not considered irreparable injury.  The threatened destruction of one’s 
home or business may constitute irreparable injury , although the threatened foreclosure 
of unimproved commercial property may not.  An order directing release of privileged 
information, disclosure of attorney work product, or invasion of a protected privacy 
interest ordinarily will qualify as irreparable injury.  You need to judge the circumstances 
and the sever ity of the consequences to determine whether you are likely to qualify  for 
extraordinary  writ relief . 
 
Types of Writs and Time Limits for Filing a Petition  
 
1.  Statutory Writs  
 
The Legislature has enacted statutes specifying certain rulings may be reviewed by 
writ petition — hence the term “ statutory writ. ”  (A non-exhaustive list of statutory writs 
is set out in Attachment A to this Handout.)  Statutory writ petitions are often required to 
be filed within a time prescribed by the statute itself , which is usually short (e.g., 10 or 20 
days).  If you fail to meet  the statutory deadline, the appellate court will not have 
jurisdiction to grant your petition.  If a statute authorizes review by writ petition but does 
not specify a time for filing the petition,  the filing period is subject to general principles 
of laches described in the discussion of “Common Law Writs” below. 
 
Just because the Legislature has authorized review by writ petition does not 
necessarily mean you h ave to file a petition to challenge a ruling.  In most cases, you may 
pass on the writ petition and still challenge the ruling on an appeal from the final 
judgment in your case.  Some  rulings, however, may only be reviewed in a writ 
proceeding.  Examples include a denial of a motion to quash service of summons for lack 
of personal jurisdiction (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (c) ); a ruling on the 
disqualification of a judge (Code Civ. Proc., § 170.3, subd. (d)); a ruling on the 
expunge ment of a notice of lis pendens (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.39); a ruling in a Public 
Records Act case (Gov. Code, §  6259, subd. (c));  and a ruling regarding revocation, 
suspension or restriction of a medical license (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 2337).  
 
2.  Common Law Writs  
 
Writs other than those prescribed by statute are called “common law writs.”  There is 
no set time limit for filing a petition for a common law writ.  Instead, general principles  3 of laches apply , and 60 days is the rule of thumb.  (See, e.g., Volkswagen of America, Inc. 
(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 695, 701.)  In other words, you should file your petition within 60 
days of the date of entry of the judgment, order or decision you are challeng ing.  If you  
file your  petition after the 60  days have run, you must explain the reason for the delay 
and show the absence of any prejudice to the opposing party.  A petition may be denied 
as untimely even if it is filed within the 60 -day period under certain circumstances (e.g., 
the petition was not filed until the eve of trial even though the challenged order was made 
some time before the trial date).  
 
What You Must Submit  
 
If you decide to file a petition for writ relief, it is very important to submit all the 
necessary components:  petition, verification, memorandum of points and authorities , 
exhibits, a certificate of interested entities or persons, a certificate of word count and any 
applicable filing fee.  (See Cal . Rules of Court, rules 8.76, 8.485 , 8.486 & 8.488 for 
details.)  It is also important to protect personal privacy rights b y excluding or redacting 
such personal identifying information as Social Security numbers, financial account 
numbers, and driver license numbers.  (Id., rules 1.201, 8.41.)  All submissions must be 
made through the court’s electronic filing system at http://www.courts.ca.gov/4dca-
efile.htm  unless you qualify for (e.g., as a self -represented litigant) or obtain (e.g., for 
undue hardship) an exemption from the electronic filing requirements.  (Id., rule 8.71.)  
 
1.  Petition  
 
The petition must set forth the name and status of each party ,1 the challenged action of 
the respondent, the grounds for the petition, and the relief requested.  You should include 
an explanation of how the respondent erred, why relief by appeal or other means is 
inadequate, and how the harm you will suffer without writ relief is irreparable.  Your  
petition must be signed and verified (i.e., attested as true under penalty of  perjury).  For 
the requirements concerning signature and verification of electronically filed documents, 
see rule 8.7 5 of the California Rules of Court.  
 
If you are exempt from the electronic filing requirements, y ou must file the original 
plus four copies of the writ petition and companion points and authorities.  (Cal. Rules of 
Court, rule 8.44(b)(3).)   The color of the cover for all paper filings in a writ proceeding is 
                                                 
1 The parties to an original writ proceeding are designated differe ntly from the way they are designated in 
the underlying action or proceeding.  The party fil ing the petition is called the petitioner ; the person, court 
or administrative agency that issued the challenge judgment, order or decision and against whom or whic h 
writ relief is sought is called the  respondent ; and the party , if any, that prevailed against the petitioner in 
the underlying action or proceeding  is called the real party in interest .  In a petition for a writ of 
supersedeas, which is not an original proceeding , the parties are designated the same way they are 
designated in the corresponding appeal (e.g., plaintiff and appellant  or defendant and respondent ).  4 red.  (Id., rule 8.40(b)(1).) 
 
2.  Memorandum of Points and Authorities  
 
A memorandum of points and authorities must set out the legal arguments that support 
your petition.  The memorandum must include citations to specific pages of the exhibits 
that support factual assertions, and citations to statutes, cases or other authorities that 
support legal assertions .  (Cal. Rules of Court, rules 204(a)(1)(B), (C), 485(a), 486(a)(5).)  
 
3.  Exhibits  
 
Your petition must include as exhibits all relevant filings presented to the court, 
administrative agency or other entity  whose  ruling you are challenging.  The exhibits 
generally should  include copies of initial  moving papers, opposition papers, reply  papers, 
relevant pleadings  (e.g., the operative complaint), and the challenged  ruling.  (Cal. Rules 
of Court, rule 8.486(b)(1)(A)-(C).)  You must also submit a copy of the reporter’s transcript of the hearing that led to the challenged ruling. (Id., rule 8.486(b)(1)(D).)  If 
you do not have a transcript, include a declaration that explains why the transcript is 
unavailable and fairly summarizes what happened at the hearing or that  states  the 
transcript has been ordered and when it will be available.  (Id., rule 8.486(b)(3).)  If you 
do not submit all required exhibits, the court may summarily deny your petition.  (Id., 
rule 8.486(b)(4).)  
 All exhibits must be submitted in portable document format (PDF) , or in a format 
readily convertible to PDF , so that the exhibits may be searched electronically .  No single 
electronic volume of exhibits may exceed 25 megabytes (see Electronic Formatting 
Requirements of the 4th District Pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 8.72(a) and 
8.74(b) ), and the pages of all exhibits must be numbered consecutively using only Arabic  
numerals.  ( Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.74(b).)  
 If you are exempt from the electronic filing requirements, y ou must index- tab each 
document in your exhibits by number or letter and consecutively  number the pages of  
your exhibits from beginning to end.  If you submit nonco mpliant exhibits, the court may 
strike or deny your petition unless, within five days  of notification of noncompliance, 
you submit a corrected volume of exhibits that has been properly tabbed and paginated.   
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.486(c)(1),  (2).)  You need to file only one set of exhibits if 
your exhibits are bound separately from your petition; but if the exhibits are bound 
together with your petition, you must file the original and four copies.  (Id., rules 8.44(b)(5) & 8.486(c)(1)(A), (3).)  
  5 4.  Certificate of Interested Entities or Persons 
 
Parties to writ proceedings are required to file a certificate of interested entities or 
persons to give the court information to avoid conflicts of interest.  If you are petitioning 
for writ relief, you must include your certificate in the petition.  If you are responding to a 
petition, you must include your certificate in your first filing.  If you do not file a 
certificate after the clerk notifies you that you must do so, the court may strike your 
filing.  (Cal. Rules  of Court, rules 8.208 & 8.488.)  
 
5.  Certificate of Word Count  
 
Your petition must contain a certificate verifying the total number of words in the 
petition and points and authorities (excluding tables, verification and certificate).  The maximum length permitted is 14,000 words including footnotes if the petition and points 
and authorities are produced by computer  and 50 pages if they are typewritten.  (Cal . 
Rules of Court, rules 8.204(c) & 8.486(a)(6).)  
 
6.  Filing Fee 
 
You are required to pay a filing fee or to complete an application for a waiver of fees 
in connection with filing a writ petition.   (Gov. Code, §§ 68926, subd. (a)(3), 68634.5; 
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.76.)  
 
Stays 
 
In connection with seeking writ relief, you may ask the Court of Appeal to stay (1) the 
enforcement of the challenged ruling or further proceedings in the underlying case while 
it is reviewing the writ petition or (2) the enforcement of a judgment or order until the 
appeal from the judgment or order is resolved. 
 
1.  Temporary Stay  
 
In general, if you need a stay while you pursue writ relief, you should first request a 
stay from  the court or other entity whose ruling you are challenging.  If you are 
requesting a stay from the C ourt of Appeal , you must indicate whether you requested a 
stay from that court or entity  (and, if not, why not) and attach  any orders granting or 
denying the request.  Be specific about the need for and timing of your request:  state 
exactly what should be stayed and why , when the stay should go into effect, how the 
denial of the stay will prejudice you, and whether granting the stay will prejudice any 
other part y.  6 If you request a stay or other imm ediate action, you must place the words “ST AY 
REQUESTED,” “IMMEDIATE RELIEF REQUESTED” or words of similar effect 
prominently  on the cover of your writ petition and identify the nature of the ruling,  
proceeding or act to be stayed and the date by which the stay is requested.  (Cal. Rules of 
Court, rules 8.116(a), 8.486(a)(7)(B).)  If you are seeking a stay of an order of , or further 
proceedings in, a trial court, y ou must also include on the cover of your petition or at the 
beginning of the text the trial court and department involved  and the name a nd telephone 
number of the trial judge whose order or proceedings you want stay ed.  (Id., rules 
8.116(b), 8.486(a)(7)(C).)  Failure to include this required information may result in the 
denial of your stay request.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.116(c).)  You are also required to 
serve a petition that requests an immediate stay by personal delivery or by an expeditious 
method consented to in advance by the real party  in interest.  If you do not do so, the 
court will not act on the stay request for five days, except to deny it summarily , unless 
you show good cause for your failure to comply .  (Ct. App., Fourth Dist., Div. One, 
Local Rule 1(a).)  
 
The Court of Appeal may issue a stay without first soliciting or receiving a response.  
(Ct. App., Fourth Dist., Div. One, Local Rule 1(a).)  Therefore, if you want to oppose a stay request, telephone the Clerk’s Office immediately to advise  you will be filing 
opposition.  
 
2.  Stay of J udgment or Order Pending Appeal  (Petition for W rit of Supersedeas ) 
 
The writ of supersedeas is essentially  a stay issued by an  appellate court in aid of its 
jurisdiction to preserve  the status quo pending an appeal from a judgment or order of a 
trial court.  Before filing a petition for writ of supersedeas, y ou should request a stay 
from the trial court.  To obtain a writ of supersedeas, you must have an appeal pending in 
the Court of Appeal; and y ou must show you will raise a substantial issue on appeal , you 
will suffer irreparable injury  without a stay , and that injury  will be greater than the injury 
to your litigation adversary  if the stay issues.  (See , generally, Cal. Rules of Court, rule 
8.112.)  
 
The same information that must be included on the cover or at the beginning of the 
text of a petition for writ of mandate or prohibition seeking a temporary stay must also be included in a petition for writ of supersedeas.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.116.)  Before 
filing the petition, you must file a notice of appeal and pay the filing fee for the appeal.  
There is no additional fee for filing the petition. 
 
Responding  to the Petition  
 
You do not have to do anything when you are served with a writ petition.  Except in  7 extraordinary circumstances requiring immediate action, the Court of Appeal will not 
take any action other than to issue a sta y or to deny the petition summarily without first 
affording you an opportunity to respond to the petition.  (Ct. App., Fourth Dist., Div. 
One, Local Rule 1(b); Ct. App., Fourth Dist., Div. One, Internal Operating Practices & 
Proc., II(A), Original Proceedings (Writs); see also Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.487 (a)(4).)  
Unless the court orders otherwise, you will be required to pay a filing fee or to complete 
an application for a waiver of fees in connection with filing a response to the petition.   
(Gov. Code, §§ 68634.5, 68926, subd. (b)(3); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.76.)  
 
If the court wants you to respond  to the petition, it will notify you and  all other parties 
and specify a due date for your response.  If you need more  time to respond, y ou must  
state how much additional time you are requesting and why you need that time in a 
written request to the court.  
 
Disposition of Writ Petition s 
 
The Court of Appeal may summarily deny a petition with or without first obtaining a 
response.  It ordinarily will not grant writ relief  unless it has first given the respondent or 
the real party in interest an opportunity to respond to the petition.  (Cal. Rules of Court, 
rule 8.487(a)(4); Ct. App., Fourth Dist., Div. One, Local Rule 1(b).)  
 
The court may grant writ relief by  issuing what is called a peremptory writ in the first 
instance.  A peremptory writ directs  the respondent to do, or to stop doing, something.  If 
the court is considering issuing a peremptory writ in the first instance, it will provide 
notice to the parties and then decide the matter by opinion without hearing oral argument.  
(See Palma v. U.S. Industrial Fasteners, Inc. (1984) 36 Cal.3d 171, 177-180.)  Issuance 
of a peremptory writ in the first instance is very rare and is limited to situations where (1) 
the petitioner’s entitlement to relief is clear (e.g., the real party in interest concedes the 
propriety of relief) and there has been clear error under well-settled principles of law and 
undisputed facts or (2) there is  some  urgency that requires  accelera tion of the normal writ 
review process.  
 
Except in those limited  circumstances,  if the court is considering granting writ relief, it 
will issue an order to show cause.   Issuance of an  order to show cause converts the matter 
into a cause  and requires the court to hear argument (if  requested) and to issue  an opinion 
with reasons stated.  
 
Review  of Writ Decisions 
 
The Court of Appeal immediately loses jurisdiction once it issues an order summari ly 
denying a writ petition and has no power to entertain a petition for rehearing or  8 reconsideration.  If you want to challenge a summary denial order, you must file a 
petition for review in the Supreme Court of California within 10 days of the date this  
court denied  the petition.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rules 8.490(b)(1)(A) & 8.500(e)(1).)  
 
If the Court of Appeal issues an order to show cause or a peremptory writ in the first 
instance, it prepares an opinion.  In such cases, unless the court provides for early finality 
under California Rule s of Court, rule 8.490(b)(2)(A), the time limits and procedures for 
rehearing and review are the same as those for appeals.  
 
Tips 
 
1.  The Court of Appeal typically handles 50 to 60 writ petitions a month, often under 
time constraints.  To improve your chances of obtaining writ relief , help the court 
understand why you need relief.  Explain the background and issues in your case as 
clearly and succinctly as possible, and focus your argument on why you need writ 
relief .  Make your exhibits user-friendly :  include only relevant documents, i nsert 
bookmarks if filing electronically, and submit manageable volumes if filing in paper.  
 
2.  Provide a complete presentation  of your case in the petition.  Make sure the petition 
accurately and completely describes the proceedings that resulted in the challenged 
ruling and includes citations to the exhibits.  Also make sure the exhibits contain the 
challenged ruling and the relevant submission s from  both sides in those proceedings.  
 3.  Generic stay requests are extremely unlikely to be granted.  Be particular in any stay  
request:  identify  exactly what you want stayed (e.g., the trial, a document production, a 
notice to vacate the premises) and the day by which you want the stay . 
 4.  Eleventh-hour writ petitions and stay requests rarely succeed.  If you obtain an 
adverse ruling and require a stay so the matter can be reviewed, do not wait until the eve of the proceeding you want stayed but instead file your  petition as soon as possible.  
 
5.  If you intend to file a petition that requires action by the court that same day or the  
next day, telephone the Clerk’s Office to advise you will be filing the petition, when  you 
anticipate filing it, and what you will be asking the court to do.  If the urgency dissipates 
or you decide not to file the petition, let the court know.

MISCELLANEOUS ORDER 22-1 
FILING OF NOTICES OF APPEAL BY SUPERIOR COURT CLERK 
THE COURT: 
The superior court clerk is DIRECTED to receive any and all documents 
purporting or represented to be, or that could be interpreted as, a notice of appeal 
regardless of form as long as the document has sufficient information to determine by reasonable research the case in which the document is to be filed. “Notice of 
appeal” includes, without limitation, a statement or application for a certificate of 
probable cause. (Pen. Code, § 1237.5; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.304(b).) If the nature of the document as a notice of appeal is uncertain and the superior court clerk intends to reject it or take no action respecting it, the superior court clerk is 
DIRECTED to contact the clerk of this court and ask for instructions before the 
rejection or decision to take no action. In no case may the superior court clerk reject, or take no action respecting, a document purporting or represented to be, or 
interpretable as, a notice of appeal because it is untimely or a notice of appeal was 
previously filed, or because of technical defects, such as, for example without limitation, being handwritten or on paper without numbered lines. 
Immediately upon the physical receipt of any document purporting to be, or 
interpretable as, a notice of appeal by any member of the superior court clerk’s Court of Appeal

ELECTRONICALLY FILED
By:  B. )UH\3:27 pm, Feb 04, 20225 office in any courtroom or clerk’s office of any superior court branch, district or 
division, the superior court clerk is further DIRECTED to stamp on the document 
both (1) that the document has been received and (2) the date of receipt. This 
direction applies, for example and without limitation, to a statement or application for certificate of probable cause, which must be so stamped even before it is 
submitted to a judge for decision. This direction also applies, for example and 
without limitation, to a branch superior court clerk’s office that does not regularly process appeals, in which case the document must be so stamped before it is transmitted to the appropriate office. Good cause appears in that the date of actual 
receipt is critical to the determination whether this court has jurisdiction over the 
appeal and in that it is the duty of an appellate court to determine whether it has jurisdiction in a case. (See, e.g., Jennings v. Marralle (1994) 8 Cal.4th 121, 126 
[reviewing court must take initiative in determining jurisdiction “whenever a doubt exists”].) 
The order remains effective unless and until the order is vacated or 
superseded by an order of this court.

MISCELLANEOUS ORDER 22-2 
CLERK’S TRANSCRIPTS TO INCLUDE BENOIT ORDERS 
THE COURT: 
The superior court clerk is DIRECTED to include in the clerk’s transcript 
for any criminal appeal a copy of any order, by this court or the superior court, 
directing the superior court clerk to permit the filing of a late notice of appeal. (See, e.g., In re Benoit (1973) 10 Cal.3d 72, 86-89.) 
Good cause appears in that either appellant’s or respondent’s counsel may 
not be aware that an untimely notice of appeal was the subject of such an order, and unnecessarily expend time and resources addressing the late notice. 
The order remains effective unless and until the order is vacated or 
superseded by an order of this court.

MISCELLANEOUS ORDER 22-3 
AUTOMATIC EXTENSIONS TO FI LE REPORTER’S TRANSCRIPTS 
THE COURT: 
Except in cases excluded below, all certified shorthand reporters are 
GRANTED a 60-day extension to file the reporter’s transcript in all civil cases and 
criminal cases. (Cal. Rules of Court, rules 8.60(b), 8.130(f)(1), 8.336(d)(3), (e)(2).) In civil cases, the extension is of the 30-day time limit (Cal. Rules of 
Court, rule 8.130(f)(1)) automatically extending the time to file a reporter’s transcript to 90 days. In criminal cases, the extension is of the 20-day time limit (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.336(d)(3)) automatically extending the time to file a reporter’s transcript to 80 days. 
This automatic extension means that the reporter must deliver the reporter’s 
transcript to the superior court clerk in time for the superior court clerk, appeals division, to file the reporter’s transcript with the clerk of this court no later than 
the 91st day in civil cases and the 81st day in criminal cases. Thus, if the reporter’s transcript is delivered on the 80th (criminal) or 90th (civil) day: (1) to the San Bernardino County Superior Court Clerk, it must be delivered to the 
Appeals Division at 8303 N. Haven Ave., Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91730; (2) to 
the Riverside County Superior Court Clerk, it must be delivered to the Appeals Court of Appeal
Fourth Appellate District 
Division Two
ELECTRONICALLY FILED
By:  B. )UH\3:28 pm, Feb 04, 20228 Division in the Hall of Justice in Riverside; to the Inyo County Superior Court 
Clerk, it must be delivered as dire
cted by the superior court clerk. 
However, if the reporter’s transcript is delivered to a superior court location 
other than those designated in the preceding sentence, then the transcript must be delivered by the time prescribed by the superior court clerk. Thus, the superior 
court clerk may shorten the extension as many days as necessary to ensure that 
delivery by the reporter to an undesignated court location will still result in timely delivery of the record to the clerk of this court. 
This automatic extension also means that a reporter need not file a written 
extension request unless the reporter intends to exceed the 90-day period in civil 
cases or the 80-day period in criminal cases. 
A. Because the following proceedings are generally short, the extension
granted by this order does not a
pply in the following civil cases in which the 
appeal is from a judgment or order: 
1. of dismissal after the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend;
2.granting or denying a special motion to st rike for bringing a strategic lawsuit
against public particip
ation (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16) or a SLAPPback action
(Code Civ. 
Proc., § 425.18);
3. based on an order granting summary judgmen t;
4. of dismissal for failure to proceed timely;
5. based on a default;
6. on an order to show cause in a family law proceeding;9 7. post-judgment orders;
8. granting a motion to quash service;
9. granting or denying a motion to stay or dismiss for inconvenient forum;
10. granting, dissolving, or denying a temporary re straining order, preliminary
injunction, or injunction;
11. appointing a receiver.
B. Because the following proceedings are entitled to calendar
preference, the extension granted 
by this order does not apply in the following 
juvenile and civil cases in which the appeal is from a judgment or order: 
1. in a juvenile case (Code Civ. Proc., § 45; Welf. & Inst. Code, §§ 395, 800);

THE COURT: 
The superior court clerk is DIRECTED to permit representatives of 
Appellate Defenders’ Inc. (ADI), and any counsel appointed by this
 court, to view 
and copy the superior court file and exhibits of their clients’ cases, and any related 
cases, to the same extent that their clients or their trial counsel would be permitted

denial of access necessary, the superior court clerk is DIRECTED to discuss by telephone the denial of access with the clerk of this court first before denying 
access. 
These cases include all criminal, juvenile dependency, and juvenile 
delinquency cases, as well as all cases concerning the commitment of persons with 
intellectual disabilities (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 6500 et seq.), all cases under the 
Sexually Violent Predators Act (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 6600 et seq.), all cases

ADI and counsel appointed by this court shall be permitted to view and 
copy all portions of the file, including sealed and confidential documents and exhibits, to the same extent as the party (or party’s trial counsel) on whose behalf 
ADI requests access to the file. Access to the superior court file shall be permitted 
as provided above to a person who presents a personal identification document with a photograph (such as a driver’s license) and either a business card showing that they are employed by ADI or a copy of this court’s order appointing them as 
counsel. 
Good cause appears in that ADI has contracted with the State of California 
on behalf of indigent parties to investigate the viability of writ petitions and appeals, and to arrange appointment of, assist, and supervise appellate counsel. 
Good cause appears also in that this court’s appointment gives appointed appellate 
counsel the same authority to act on behalf of the party on appeal as trial counsel 
had to act on behalf of the same party in the superior court proceedings.

CRIMINAL AND JUVENILE TRIAL COUNSEL NOT TO REPRESENT 
CLIENTS ON APPEAL 
THE COURT: 
In criminal and juvenile appeals, the court will not appoint the appellant’s 
trial attorney to represent the appellant on appeal, because trial counsel is not able 
to objectively review the record to determine if trial counsel committed ineffective 
assistance of counsel. ( People v. Bailey (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1254-1255 
[trial counsel may not be appointed to represent on appeal the defendant he 
represented at trial]. See People v. Kipp (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1100, 1139 
[“representation by the same attorney at trial and on appeal” entails “‘an inherent 
conflict’ because counsel ‘is in the untenable position of urging his own 
incompetency’” citing Bailey with approval].) If trial counsel wants the appeal to 
raise a particular issue, trial counsel may discuss the issue with appointed 
appellate counsel. 
Furthermore and for the same reason, in criminal and juvenile appeals, the 
court discourages the appellant’s trial attorney, whether retained or appointed by 
the trial court, from representing appellant on appeal beyond filing the notice of 
appeal. By “retained” the court refers to all counsel who are not appointed by a 
court, including without limitation those who have been paid a retainer or fees, Court of Appeal

performed or intend to perform appellate attorney services for no compensation. 
Furthermore and for the same reason, this court discourages the public 
defender’s office from representing a client the public defender’s office represented at trial in an appeal in which the client is the appellant. Even though 
Government Code section 27706, subdivision (a), authorizes the public defender 
to represent on appeal clients the public defender represented at trial, that authorization does not remove the inherent conflict of interest. If the public defender’s office nevertheless decides to represent on appeal a defendant the 
public defender’s office represented in the trial court, this court urges the public 
defender’s office to use counsel other than the counsel who represented the appellant in the trial court.

ORAL ARGUMENT LIMITED TO 15 MINUTES 
THE COURT: 
Since the tentative opinion focuses oral argument, no more than 15 minutes 
of oral argument is allowed for eac
h side, except for good cause. (Cal. Rules of 
Court, rule 8.256(c).) The court is not unalterably bound by the tentative opinion, 
will thoughtfully consider all oral arguments made, and is willing to amend or 
discard the tentative opinion if counsel’s arguments persuade the court that the tentative opinion is incorrect in any way. (See People v. Pena (2004) 32 Cal.4th 
389, 399-400.) 
Counsel may request additional time by serving and filing a letter 
application with the clerk of this court, on or before 15 days after the date of mailing of the formal calendar, which notifies counsel when oral argument is set. Good cause for additional time is shown when the issues counsel still contests 
after reviewing the tentative opinion are more numerous or complex, or both, than 
in most orally argued cases.

oral argument, including applications for permission to file supplemental briefing. Court of Appeal

Because of the reliance of trial courts and counsel on police reports as a

CLERK’S AND REPORTER’S TRANSCRIPTS IN NON-CAPITAL, 
MULTIPLE DEFENDANT CRIMINAL APPEALS 
THE COURT: 
Introduction 
This or
der applies to clerk’s and reporter’s transcripts in non-capital, 
multiple defendant criminal cases. The purpose of this order is to facilitate 
appellate review by producing a core, initial clerk’s and reporter’s transcript for all 
defendants, eliminating duplicate transcription of the same proceedings for each defendant, and minimizing supplemental records for defendants appealing after the first appeal. The term “proceedings” includes all oral proceedings required to be 
included in the normal record in a particular case. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 
8.320(c) [oral proceedings included in normal record].) The term “reporter” includes all reporters reporting any proceedings in the particular case. 
Notifying reporters 
1. When the first notice of appeal is filed, the appeals division must send a
notice to the reporter 
for the dates of all proceedings for all defendants, including 
any who have not filed an appeal in the case. 
2. Each time a notice of appeal is subsequently filed prior to the certification
of the initial record to the 
court of appeal, and only if there were proceedings after Court of Appeal

By:  B. )UH\3:32 pm, Feb 04, 202227 those included in the initial notice, the appeals division must send the reporter an 
“amended notice” listing both the dates in the initial notice and the dates for all 
defendants of all proceedings that were not included in the initial notice. These 
additional proceedings must be included by the reporter in the initial reporter’s transcript unless the appeals division, afte
r consultation with the court of appeal 
clerk’s office, gives permission to include the additional proceedings in a 
supplemental reporter’s transcript. 
3. Each time a notice of appeal is filed after the certification of the initial
record, and only if there were any proceedings after those included in the initial 
notice and any ame
nded notice, the appeals division must send the reporter a 
“supplemental notice” listing only the dates for all defendants of all proceedings 
that were not included in the initial and any amended notices; these proceedings must be transcribed in a supplemental reporter’s transcript. 
4. Amended and su pplemental notices must direct the reporter to comply with
the requirements for originals and copies of initial and supplemental reporter’s transcripts. 
(See below “Originals and Copies.”) 
All Defendants’ Names on Covers 
1. The names of all defendants, including any who have not filed an appeal,
must appear on the covers for the initial and any supplemental clerk’s and reporter’s transcripts. 28 2. The name or names of the defendant or defe ndants who have filed a notice
of appeal must be highlighted or the prin
t bolded on the covers of the initial and 
any supplemental clerk’s and reporter’s transcripts. 
Originals and Copies 
An original and two copies must be prepared of the initial and any 
supplemental clerk’s and reporter’s transcripts for the first defendant who 
appealed; an additional copy of the initial and any supplemental clerk’s and 
reporter’s transcripts must be prepared for each defendant who subsequently has filed a notice of appeal. 
Due Date for Initial Reporter’s Transcript 
When each subsequent notice of appeal is filed prior to the delivery of the 
initial reporter’s transcript, the due date for the initial reporter’s transcript is 
1. the original due date plus
2. the difference in days between
a.the filing date of the first notice of appeal and
b.the filing date of the subseque nt notice of appeal,
3. but if the difference exceeds 30 days, add only 30 days to the ori ginal due
date.
Exa
mple A: 
First Appeal: Filed January 1, 2008 – Due 80 days, March 21, 2008 
2nd Appeal
: Filed January 15, 2008 29 To the original due date of March 21, 2008 we add the difference between January 
1 and January 15, which is 14 days. Thus March 21 plus 14 days is April 4, the 
new due date. 
Example B: 
Same January 1, 2008, filing date for first appeal, so same original due date of 
March 21, 2008, but the second appeal is filed February 15, 2008. 
The difference between January 1 and February 15 is over 30 days. 
So, the original due date of March 21 would be extended only 30 days to 
April 20, 2008. 
Problem Cases 
If the procedure described in this order is not the most efficient way to 
achieve the purpose of this rule, the clerk may confer with the primary reporter 
and appeals supervisor, who may contact the court of appeal for directions.

NO AUTOMATIC APPOINTMENT OF NON-APPEALING MINOR’S 
COUNSEL 
THE COURT: 
No counsel will be appointed for a non-appealing minor except when the 
court determines that, in the context of a particular appeal, the best interests of the 
minor require the appointment. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 5.661(c)(1) 
[minor’s trial counsel or guardian ad litem to recommend appointment of appellate 
counsel if minor’s “best interests cannot be protected without the appointment”], (c)(2), (f) [factors to be considered].) 
Any party or counsel in trial or appellate proceedings may inform the court 
of any factors known to them that would indicate appointment of counsel to be in the minor’s best interests. However, the rule places the burden especially on the minor’s trial counsel to make a timely recommendation no more than 20 days after the filing of the last appellant’s opening brief. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 
5.661(d).) Because waiting until the filing of the last appellant’s opening brief 
would most likely result in the delay of the appeal, and because minor’s trial counsel are mailed a copy of the notification of filing of notice of appeal (Cal. 
Rules of Court, rule 8.405(b)(1)(A)(ii) [notification mailed to “attorney of record

* If you wish to participate in oral argument, you must file the attached form with proof of service on opposing counsel with the court within 15 days from the date of this notice.
* If oral argument is requested, the case will likely be set for oral argument within the next six months.
* Please notify the court of any dates you are unavailable to appear within the next six months, or thereafter if known, and we will try to accommodate your schedule.

The form also specifies that notification of the date and time for oral argument will be sent to all parties electronically via the court's electronic filing service provider, True Filing. Parties are responsible for monitoring their email and mail for any notifications from the court. Any request for a continuance of oral argument must be made no later than 15 days after the date we email or mail the oral argument calendar to you. A request for a continuance submitted later will be considered only if it is necessitated by an emergency. Any request for a continuance must include a declaration stating whether opposing counsel agrees to or opposes a continuance.

If you do not request oral argument within the time specified above, oral argument will be deemed waived. If oral argument is waived, the case will likely be submitted within the next six months.

If your case settles after you receive the oral argument calendar, you must immediately notify the court by telephone. Failure to give timely notice of a settlement may result in the imposition of sanctions."

The Court of Appeal of the State of California, Fourth Appellate District, has ordered that effective January 13, 2014, the prohibition against disclosure of material in a confidential record does not apply to references to material contained in a probation report that is part of the record on appeal.

In other words, the Court of Appeal has ruled that it is permissible to refer to material contained in a probation report that is part of the record on appeal, even if that material would otherwise be considered confidential. This ruling is intended to facilitate the appellate process by allowing parties to discuss and analyze all of the relevant evidence, including information that may be contained in a probation report."

INFORMATION SHEET FOR PROOF OF SERVICE 
(COURT OF APPEAL)
GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT SERVICE AND PROOF OF SERVICE
This information sheet provides instructions for completing Proof of Service (Court of Appeal) (form APP-009) or Proof of 
Electronic Service (Court of Appeal)  (form APP-009E). This information sheet is not part of the proof of service and does 
not need to be copied, served, or filed. 
Rule 8.25 of the California Rules of Court provides that before filing any document in the Court of Appeal, a party must 
serve one copy of the document on the attorney for each party separately represented, on each unrepresented party, and on any other person or entity when required by statute or rule. Other rules specifically require that certain documents be served, including the notice of appeal and notice designating the record on appeal in civil appeals and briefs in both civil and criminal appeals. 
To ""serve"" a document on a person means to have that document delivered to the person. The general requirements 
concerning service are set out in Code of Civil Procedure sections 1010.6–1013a. Section 1010.6(a)(2)(A)(ii) addresses electronic service in the trial courts, or superior courts, including their appellate divisions. Rule 8.78 of the California Rules of Court addresses electronic service in any case in the Court of Appeal. There are three main ways to serve documents: (1) by mail, (2) by personal delivery, or (3) by electronic service. Regardless of what method of service is used, the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a document in a court case can only be served by a person who is over 18 years of age. Service by mail or personal delivery must be by someone who is not a party in the case; electronic service may be performed directly by a party. Electronic service may be by (1) electronic transmission, transmitting a document to the electronic service address of a person; or by (2) electronic notification, sending a message to the electronic service address specifying the exact name of the document served and providing a hyperlink at which the served document may be viewed and downloaded. 
If you are a party to the case and wish to serve documents by mail or personal delivery, you must therefore have 
someone else who is over 18 and who is not a party to the case serve any documents in your case. You will need to give the person doing the serving (the server) the names and addresses of all those who must be served. You will also need to give the server one copy of each document that needs to be served for each person or entity that is being served.
If you are serving documents electronically, you can do this yourself or have another person over 18 do it for you. The 
person doing the serving (the server) will need the names and electronic service addresses of all those who must be served, and the document to be served in a form that allows it to be electronically transmitted or made available by hyperlink.
Rule 8.25 also requires the party filing a document in the court to attach to the document presented for filing a proof of 
service showing the required service, or if using an electronic filing service provider's automatic electronic document 
service, the party may have the electronic filing service provider generate a proof of service. Proof of Service (Court of 
Appeal) (form APP-009) or Proof of Electronic Service (Court of Appeal)  (form APP-009E) may be used to provide proof 
of service in any proceeding in the Court of Appeal. The server should follow the instructions below for completing the Proof of Service (Court of Appeal) (form APP-009) or Proof of Electronic Service (Court of Appeal)  (form APP-009E). If 
another person is serving the documents for you—as is required if the document will be served by mail or personal 
delivery—tell the server to give you the original form when it is completed. You will need to attach this original proof of service to the document you are filing.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE SERVER (THE PERSON WHO IS SERVING THE DOCUMENTS) IF SERVING BY MAIL OR 
PERSONAL DELIVERY 
If you are serving a document for a party in a court case, it is your responsibility to prepare the proof of service. You can

SUPREME COURT, COURT OF APPEAL, APPELLATE DIVISION— APP-015/FW-015-INFO 
Page 1 of 2APP-015/FW-015-INFO 
INFORMATION SHEET ON WAIVER OF APPELLATE COURT FEES 
SUPREME COURT, COURT OF APPEAL, APPELLATE DIVISION —
If you file an appeal, a petition for a writ, or a petition for review in a civil case, such as a family law case or a case in 
which you sued someone or someone sued you, you must generally pay a filing fee to the court. If you are a party other 
than the party who filed the appeal or the petition, you must also generally pay a fee when you file your first document in 
a case in the Court of Appeal or Supreme Court. You and the other parties in the case may also have to pay other court 
fees in these proceedings, such as fees to prepare or get a copy of a clerk’s transcript in an appeal. However, if you cannot 
afford to pay these court fees and costs, you may ask the court to issue an order saying you do not have to pay these fees 
(this is called “waiving” these fees).  
1.  Who can get their court fees waived? The court will waive your court fees and costs if: 
• You are getting public assistance, such as Medi-Cal; Food Stamps; Supplemental Security Income ( not Social 
Security); State Supplemental Payment; County Relief/General Assistance; In-Home Supportive Services; 
CalWORKS; Tribal Temporary Assistance for Needy  Families; Cash Assistance Program for Aged, Blind, and 
Disabled; Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC Program); or 
unemployment compensation. 
You have a low income level . Under the law you are considered a low-income person if the gross monthly  income 
(before deductions for taxes) of your household is less than the amount listed below: 
Family Size Family Income Family Size Family Income Family Size Family Income 
1 $2,430.00 3 $4,143.34 5 $5,856.67
2 $3,286.67 4 $5,000.00 6 $6,713.34If more than 6 people at  
home, add $856.67 for  
each extra person. • 
You do not have enough income to pay for your household’s basic needs and your court fees. • 
2.  What fees and costs will the court waive? If you qualify for a fee waiver, the Supreme Court, Court 
of Appeal, or Appellate Division will waive the filing fee for the notice of appeal, a petition for a writ, a petition for 
review, or the first document filed by a party other than the party who filed the appeal or petition, and any court fee for 
participating in oral argument by telephone. The trial court will also waive costs related to the clerk’s transcript on appeal, 
the fee for the court to hold in trust the deposit for a reporter's transcript on appeal under rule 8.130(b) or rule 8.834(b) of 
the California Rules of Court, and the fees for making a transcript or copy of an official electronic recording under rule 
8.835. If you are the appellant (the person who is appealing the trial court decision), the fees waived include the deposit 
required under Government Code section 68926.1 and the costs for preparing and certifying the clerk’s transcript and 
sending the original to the reviewing court and one copy to you. If you are the respondent (a party other than the appellant 
in a case that is being appealed), the fees waived include the costs for sending you a copy of the clerk’s transcript. You 
can also ask the trial court to waive other necessary court fees and costs.  
The court cannot waive the fees for preparing a reporter’s transcript in a civil case. A special fund, called the Transcript 
Reimbursement Fund, may help pay for the transcript. (See  www.courtreportersboard.ca.gov/ consumers/index.shtml#trf  
and Business and Professions Code sections 8030.2 and following for more information about this fund.) If you are unable 
to pay the cost of a reporter’s transcript, a record of the oral proceedings can be prepared in other ways, by preparing an 
agreed statement or, in some circumstances, a statement on appeal or settled statement.  
3.  How do I ask the court to waive my fees?
Appeal in Limited Civil Case (civil case in which the amount of money claimed is $25,000 or less). In a limited 
civil case, if the trial court already issued an order waiving your court fees and that fee waiver has  not ended (fee 
waivers automatically end 60 days after the judgment), the fees and costs identified in item 2 above are already waived; 
just give the court a copy of your current fee  waiver. If you do not already have an order waiving your fees or you had 
a fee waiver but it has ended, you must complete and file a  Request to Waive Court Fees  (form FW-001). If you are the 
appellant (the party  who is appealing), you should check both boxes in item 4 on FW-001 and file the completed form 
with your notice of appeal. If you are the respondent (a party other than the appellant in a case that is being appealed), 
the completed form should be filed in the court when the fees you are requesting to be waived, such as the fee for the 
clerk’s transcript or telephonic oral argument, are due.• Rev. April 1, 2023INFORMATION SHEET ON WAIVER OF APPELLATE COURT FEES 
SUPREME COURT, COURT OF APPEAL, APPELLATE DIVISION— APP-015/FW-015-INFO 
Page 2 of 2Writ Proceeding in Limited Civil Case (civil case in which the amount of money claimed is $25,000 or less). If 
you want the Superior Court to waive the fees in a writ proceeding in a limited civil case, you must complete a Request 
to Waive Court Fees  (form FW-001). In item 4 on FW-001, check the second box. The completed form should be filed 
with your petition for a writ.  • 
If You Are a Guardian or Conservator. If you are a guardian or conservator or a petitioner for the appointment of a 
guardian or conservator, special rules apply to your request for a fee waiver on an appeal from an order in the 
guardianship or conservatorship proceeding or in a civil action in which you are a party acting on behalf of your ward 
or conservatee. Complete and submit a Request to Waive Court Fees (Ward or Conservatee) (form FW-001-GC) to 
request a fee waiver. See California Rules of Court, rule 7.5.• 
Appeal in Other Civil Cases.  If you want the court to waive fees and costs in an appeal in a civil case other than a 
limited civil case, such as a family law case or an unlimited civil case (a civil case in which the  amount of money 
claimed is more than $25,000), you must complete a Request to Waive Court Fees  (form  FW-001). In item 4 on 
FW-001, check the second box to ask the Court of Appeal to waive the fee for filing  the notice of appeal or, if you are a 
respondent (a party other than the one who filed the appeal), the fee for  the first document you file in the Court of 
Appeal. Check both boxes if you also want the trial court to  waive your costs for the clerk’s transcript (if the trial court 
already issued an order waiving your fees and that fee waiver has not ended,  you do not need to check the first box; the 
fees and costs identified in item 2 above are already waived, just give the court a copy of your current fee waiver). If 
you are the appellant, the  completed form should be submitted with your notice of appeal (if you check both boxes in 
item 4, the court may ask for two signed copies of this form). If you are the respondent, the completed form should be  
submitted at the time the fee you are asking the court to waive is due. For example, file the form in the trial court with 
your request for a copy of the clerk’s transcript if you are asking the court to waive the transcript  fee or file the form in 
the Court of Appeal with the first document you file in that court if you are asking the  court to waive the fee for filing 
that document. To request waiver of a court fee for telephonic oral  argument, you should file the completed form in the 
Court of Appeal when the fee for telephonic oral argument is due.  • 
Writ Proceeding in Other Civil Cases. If you want the Supreme Court or Court of Appeal to waive the  fees and costs  
in a writ proceeding in a civil case other than a limited civil case, such as a family law case or an unlimited civil case (a 
civil case in which the amount of money claimed is more than $25,000), you must  complete a  Request to Waive Court 
Fees (form FW-001). If you are the petitioner (the party filing the  petition), the completed form should be submitted   
with your petition for a writ in the Supreme Court or  Court of Appeal clerk’s office. If you are a party other than the 
petitioner, the completed form should be filed with the first document you file in the Supreme Court or Court of Appeal. • 
Petition for Review. If you want to request that the Supreme Court waive the fees in a petition for review  proceeding, 
you must complete a Request to Waive Court Fees  (form FW-001) or a Request to Waive Court Fees (Ward or 
Conservatee) (form FW-001-GC). If you are the petitioner, you should submit the completed form with your petition 
for review. If you are a party other than the  petitioner, the completed form should be filed with the first document you 
file in the Supreme Court. • 
IMPORTANT INFORMATION! 
Fill out your request completely and truthfully. When you sign your request for a fee waiver, you are  declaring 
under penalty of perjury that the information you have provided is true and correct. • 
The court may ask you for information and evidence. You may be ordered to go to court to answer questions about 
your ability to pay court fees and costs and to provide proof of eligibility. Any initial fee waiver you are granted may 
be ended if you do not go to court when asked. You may be ordered to repay amounts that were waived if the court 
finds you were not eligible for the fee waiver.  • 
If you receive a fee waiver, you must tell the court if there is a change in your finances. You must tell  the court 
immediately if your finances improve or if you become able to pay court fees or costs during this  case (file form 
FW-010 with the court). You may be ordered to repay any amounts that were waived after your eligibility ended. If the 
trial court waived your fees and costs and you settle your case for $10,000 or more, the trial court will have a lien on 
the settlement in the amount of the waived fees. • 
The fee waiver ends. The fee waiver expires 60 days after the judgment, dismissal, or other final disposition of the 
case or when the court finds that you are not eligible for a fee waiver.   •","This form is for people who can't afford to pay court fees when filing an appeal, petition for a writ, or petition for review in a civil case. Eligibility for a fee waiver is based on public assistance, low-income level, or not having enough income to pay for basic needs and court fees. If approved, the court will waive filing fees, costs related to clerk's transcript on appeal, fee for court to hold in trust deposit for a reporter's transcript on appeal, and fees for making a transcript or copy of an official electronic recording. You must submit a Request to Waive Court Fees form to be considered for a fee waiver."

Rule 1.  MEDIATION 
 
(a) [Application of rule] This rule is adopted pursuant to rule 8.248, California Rules of Court, and shall apply to all civil appeals filed in the Sixth District Court of 
Appeal.  
(b) [Purpose of Mediation Program] To aid the expeditious and just resolution of civil appeals, the Court of Appeal for the S ixth Distr ict has established a mediation 
Program (""Program""). Procedures for mediation and operation of the Program shall be promulgated by and the Program shall be a dministered by the Administrative 
Presiding Justice or a designated Supervising Justice, and their designated staff.  
(c) [Scope of Mediation Program] At the court's discretion, any civil appeal may be placed in the Program if selected by the court or requested in writing by a party. The 
Court may, at its discretion, remove an appeal from the Program.  
(d) [Mediators] 
(1) The court shall maintain a list of attorneys who have developed expertise in specified areas of law, are generally respec ted in the legal community, and 
are willing to mediate cases at this court. These attorneys shall be designated as me diators and preside over mediations conducted within the scope of the 
Program.  
(2) A justice or assigned justice of this court may, at the court's discretion, be designated as a mediator and preside over a mediation. A justice or assigned 
justice who parti cipates in a mediation that does not result in complete settlement shall not thereafter participate in any way in the consideration or 
disposition of the case on its merits.  
(3) A justice or assigned justice of the court will not be disqualified to partici pate in the consideration or disposition of a case on its merits because he or she 
has ruled on a request for a mediation, ordered that a mediation be held, signed orders granting relief from default for an a ct required under this rule, 
extended or shorten ed any time period specified in this rule, or otherwise signed an order concerning a procedural aspect of the mediation process.  
(e) [General Mediation Program Procedure]  
(1) Upon receipt of notice of the filing of a notice of a civil appeal, the clerk of this court shall mail a copy of this rule and a Mediation Statement Form to 
counsel for all parties.  
(2) The Mediation Statement Form shall be returned to this court within 15 days from the date of mailing. Each party shall al so serve a copy of their 
comp leted Mediation Statement Form on all other parties.  
(3) The Mediation Statement Form shall be transmitted by the Clerk to the Program and shall not be entered into the court fil e.  
(4) Within 15 days of receipt of the Mediation Statement Forms, the court  shall notify the parties when a case is selected for mediation and furnish the name, 
address and telephone number of the mediator selected for the mediation. The court shall provide three possible dates for med iation.  
(5) The parties shall meet and confe r to agree on the date of mediation, and inform the court within 5 days of the date selected for mediation. The court will 
issue written notice of the date and time of the mediation. The mediator, with the approval of the Court, may, for good cause, postpo ne or continue a 
mediation session to a date certain.  
(6) The Court may replace a selected mediator upon written request by a party supported by a showing of good cause or upon re quest of the mediator.  
(7) Immediately upon acceptance of a case into the P rogram, all further proceedings, including the filing of briefs, shall be suspended for 90 days. However, 
this rule shall not suspend preparation of the appellate record unless a specific order is issued directing suspension of rec ord preparation. Upon the  expiration 
of the stay, the appeal shall be reinstated to active status on the court's docket. Any request for further stay shall be gra nted only upon written application to 
the court and only upon a showing of good cause.  
(8) Mediation services shall be  furnished by the Court without fee to the parties for up to a total of 4 hours. Any further mediation services shall be at th e 
discretion of the mediator, on such terms as the mediator and the parties may agree upon, and consistent with the provisions of this rule.  
(f) [Mediation Hearing and Sanctions]  
(1) All parties and their counsel of record must attend all mediation sessions in person with full settlement authority. If t he party is not an individual, then a 
party representative with full authority to  settle all appeals and cross -appeals must attend all mediation sessions in person, in addition to counsel. If a party 
has potential insurance coverage applicable to any of the issues in dispute, a representative of each insurance carrier whose  policy may apply must also 
attend all mediation sessions in person, with full settlement authority. Any exception to this requirement must be approved i n writing by the Court. Failure to 
attend may result in the imposition of sanctions against any party or counsel, i ncluding dismissal.  
(2) The mediator may invite parties to the action who are not parties to the appeal, or any person who has an interest in the  action, to attend the mediation if 
it appears to the mediator that their presence may facilitate settlement o f the case. Any party to the appeal may serve and file a written request for the 
attendance of such a party or person at least 15 days before the mediation.  
(3) Counsel shall confer with their clients in advance and be thoroughly familiar with the case an d prepared to present their contentions in detail.  
(4) The presiding justice, a justice designated by the presiding justice, or the mediator may excuse a client's personal atte ndance upon request and a showing

THE COURT: 
Miscellaneous Order No. 22-001, dated August 26, 2022, setting forth the court’s 
COVID-19 oral argument protocols, is hereby vacated.   
Oral argument in the Sixth District is currently being conducted in-person.  Counsel 
appearing for oral argument may choose to appear in person, or remotely via 
videoconferencing through BlueJeans.  
Commencing with the June 2023 oral argument calendar, and continuing unless 
otherwise ordered by the court, the courtroom will be open to the public and media on a 
first come, first served basis.  The public will continue to have access to arguments via live 
streaming on the court’s website,  https://www.courts.ca.gov/11670.htm .  Recordings of 
oral arguments will continue to be archived for subsequent viewing online. 
Regardless of vaccination status, all counsel and all members of the public who 
enter the courtroom are strongly encouraged to wear well-fitted face coverings. Counsel 
may, and are encouraged to, remove their masks when presenting argument. 
No person shall enter the courtroom if that person (a) has tested positive for 
COVID-19 within the previous five days; (b) is ill and currently awaiting the results of a 
COVID-19 test; (c) has had a fever within the prior 24 hours; or (d) has had symptoms 
consistent with COVID-19 that have persisted over the previous five days. 
Any counsel who initially planned to appear in person for oral argument but who

positive COVID-19 test in advance of oral argument) must notify opposing counsel and the clerk of the court immediately regarding, and to arrange for, remote participation via 
videoconferencing through BlueJeans.  The court retains discretion to deny the request, 
grant it and allow for remote participation, postpone oral argument if necessary, or take 
other action as may be appropriate.
