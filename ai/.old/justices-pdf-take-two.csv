PERSONAL   
  
 Married to United States District Judge Margaret  Morrow, and parent of Patrick Morrow Boland  Second District Court of Appeal is sad to announce the 
passing of its esteemed colleague Justice Paul Boland, Associate Justice of Division Eight. 
 
Funeral services were held Saturday, Septembe r 8, 2007for Justice Paul Boland, a distinguished 
member of the Court of Appeal, Second Appe llate District, Division Eight, who died 
unexpectedly at an area hospital on Wednesday evening after a brief illness.  He was 65 years of 
age. 
 
 “The passing of Justice Paul Boland is a treme ndous loss to California's judiciary,” declared 
Chief Justice Ronald M. George. “My friendship with him dates back to the 1970's, before his 
initial appointment to the bench.  He was a warm  and insightful individual,  possessing great legal 
and personal skills, and was an outstanding ju rist and President of the California Judges 
Association.”    
  
“The sudden passing of our friend and colleague Justice Paul Boland is a great blow to all of us 
in the Second Appellate District of the Court of  Appeal,” said Administrative Presiding Justice 
Roger Boren of the Second Appellate  District.  “His death is not only a considerable professional 
loss to this court, but his departure from our liv es will weigh heavily on all of us who knew him.  
He was a towering figure in the le gal and judicial community of th e State of California.  More 
importantly those who have been fortunate to know Justice Boland for many years were keenly 
aware about his kind and considerate nature and how he always made every person with whom 
he was in contact feel important and needed.” 
 
Presiding Justice Boren continued, “I first kne w him when I was an older student at UCLA 
School of Law and Paul was a member of the law school faculty.  Later we shared adjacent court 
rooms in the superior court and served together  on the Judicial Council.  His intelligent and 
helpful suggestions and advice were always gi ven with humility and friendship.  He was a unique 
and wonderful person.” 
 
Presiding Justice Norman Epstein, of the Court of Appeal, Second Appella te District, Division 
Four, noted, “Paul Boland was the nicest, most  compassionate person I ever have known. He 
exuded those qualities, as well as so many others , to everyone who had th e privilege of knowing 
him. For any who would seek to identify someone who personifies the accolade ‘mensch,’ look no further. He is the one.” 
 
A California judge for 26 years, Justice Boland served on the Court of Appeal, Division Eight, 
since 2001. During his service as an appellate justice, he authored hundreds of opinions. He 
directed the court’s Judicial Ex ternship Program, which just rece ived one of 9 statewide awards 
for judicial innovation and excellence.  The pr ogram will receive a Ralph N. Kleps Award for 
Improvement in the Administration of the Courts at Judicial Council luncheon in Anaheim on 
September 27, 2007.  Before his appointment to the Court of Appeal, Justice  Boland served for two decades on the 
Superior Court of Los Angeles County, where he handled civil, criminal, family, and juvenile 
assignments.  He also was supervising judge  of both the Child Dependency Court and the 
Eastlake Juvenile Delinquency Court, before becoming presiding judge of the 50 Los Angeles 
County Juvenile Courts.  
As presiding judge, he supervised the design and construction of the Children’s Court, the 
nation’s first courthouse built to hear cases invo lving abused and neglected children.  He also 
established drug treatment programs for parents, youth and children in juve nile proceedings, and 
a policy for independent representati on of children in dependency cases. 
While on the Superior Court, Boland was president of the Californi a Judges Association, 
representing the state’s 2,500 judge s.  For 5 years, he also served on the Judicial Council of 
California, the policy-making body fo r the California courts, chaired by Chief Justice Ronald M. 
George.  In addition, he served for 15 months as  an assigned justice of  the Court of Appeal, 
Second Appellate District.  
 
Before his judicial career, Justice Boland served as a law clerk on the U.S.  District Court and a 
litigator with the Western Center  on Law and Poverty. He was one of three law professors who 
later established the Clin ical Legal Education Program at UCLA School of Law, where he served 
for 11 years as law professor, associate dea n, and director of clin ical legal education. 
 
Among his many honors, Justice Boland received the Los Angeles County Bar Association 
Outstanding Jurist Award; California Trial Lawyers Jurist of the Year; Consumer Attorneys 
Association of Los Angeles’ R oger Traynor Appellate Justice of the Year Award; and the Alfred 
McCourtney Trial Judge of the Year Award; Juven ile Courts Bar Associa tion Judge of the Year

demeanor is excellent. He's a strong, dynamic and forceful 
man,"" ""It's pleasant,"" ""He's got a cordial demeanor,"" ""He's a 
nice person-a cool guy"" and ""[His demeanor is] very good."" 
One lawyer disagreed with the others and opined, ""He's 
impatient and intimidating."" 
Intelligence/Knowledge 
Judge McCarville's legal knowledge was described as 
falling between average and excellent. As the interviewees 
put it, ""It's average to above average,"" ""It's excellent,"" ""It's 
above average"" and ""It's at least average-it appears to be 
adequate."" Others just said, .""It's average."" 
On Motions , 
Every interviewee said Judge McCarville usually takes 
the bench on time. Lawyers also said he is always well pre­
pared. They said, ""He reads his stuff and does his home­
work"" and ""He's very well prepared."" When asked if this 
judge rules on motions in a timely manner, every interview­
ee gave a positive response. 
On Trial 
Many of the interviewees used the word ""formal"" to 
describe Judge Mccarville courtroom management style. 
""It's a bit formal but comfortable."" ""It's in between formal 
and relaxed."" ""He's got a fairly controlled style and is effi­
cient."" ""It's very professional."" ""It's formal."" ""It's a little 
formal."" Interviewees said this judge is polite to everyone 
who appears in front of him. However, one them added, 
""but [he] can be tough when necessary. "" Another attorney 
said Judge Mccarville ""has become much more (polite) than 
when he first started."" Only one interviewee said this jurist 
is occasionally impolite. He opined, ""[He's polite) only some 
of the time. It depends on his mood."" The majority of the 
interviewees said Judge McCarville keeps an open mind and 
truly listens to their arguments. One of those who disagreed 
said he only does this ""sometimes."" The other dissenting 
interviewee responded, ""No, (he doesn't keep an open mind]. 
He usually decides what he's going to do ahead of time."" 
When asked to describe this judge's courtroom atmosphere, 
every interviewee used the word ""comfortable"" to character­
ize it. Several also said it is both ""comfortable"" and ""profes­
sional."" One lawyer voiced his minority view by saying, ""(His 
courtroom atmosphere is] a little tense."" Most of the inter­
viewees said this judge gets his decisions out on time. At 
least one of them said they are usually issued straight from 
the bench. One attorney disagreed with the others and said 
Judge McCarville is ""a little slower"" than the others when 
it comes to getting his decisions out. The interviewees who 
have received written decisions from this judge described 
them in the following ways. ""They're good,"" ""(They're] of 
average quality"" and ""They're well researched and reasoned. 
He'll give you a factual basis for his decisions."" Interviewees 
seem generally pleased· with this jurist's ability to manage 
his calendar in a timely manner. While half of them said 
he moves cases at an ""average "" pace, others opined, ""(He 
moves them] faster"" than the other judges, ""pretty fast"" and 
""faster or quicker"" than the other jurists. 
Continuances 
Most interviewees believe Judge Mccarville is fair about 
granting continuances based upon good cause. Their com­
ments included, ""[You've got an] average to above average 
chance of getting him to grant (one],"" ""If both sides agree, he'll 
grant one,"" ""He exercises his discretion reasonably well in this 
regard"" and ""It's not a problem getting him to grant one for 
good cause."" 
Settlement 
Interviewees are basically pleased with Judge McCarville 's 
efforts to help settle their cases. Some described him as ""pro­
active."" Others opined, ""[His settlement skills are) excellent, "" 
""If you request his help, he'll get involved,"" ""He'll try to help"" 
and ""He's somewhat proactive"" in helping attorneys settle 
their cases. 
Proclivities 
Only. a .co_uple o.f ~he intervie~ee~ criticized Judge 
Mccarville s impartiality. They said, In criminal cases, 
he leans toward the prosecution"" and ""He's pretty fair. He 
might lean a little toward the D.A."" All of the others offered California Courts and Judges 
more positive comments. ""He's a very fair man."" ""He's 
impartial."" ""He's very fair."" ""He's fair."" 
Summary 
Additional comments included: ""Be sure your paperwork 
is filed on time and everything you want is in it""; ""He can 
be unpredictable in a good, surprising way that benefits 
the defense""; and ""He prefers the local attorneys-the oth­
ers receive fewer breaks."" Nearly every interviewee praised 
Judge McCarville's courtroom demeanor. All of them said 
his legal knowledge is adequate or even ""above average"" 
compared to that of other local jurists. There was some 
slight split of opinion regarding his overall impartiality. 
However, one of the attorneys claimed, ""He's probably the 
fairest judge at the central courthouse."" (OlE)

ATTORNEYS ' COMMENTS 
Temperament/Demeanor 
Attorneys who were interviewed about Judge McCormick 
were unanimous in praise for his demeanor. ""I have a very 
favorable impression of him. He is a pleasant individual to 
work with,"" said one. Another said he is ""a good guy,"" while 
a third interviewee said he is ""very pleasant. There is great 
decorum in his courtroom. It is not· a shouting match. I 
really like working with him."" A fourth attorney said, ""He is 
a very personable judge to be around."" Though the attorney 
hasn't socialized with him off the bench, ""he is one of the 
few judges that I have met who I could see associating with 
outside of the courtroom,"" the attorney said. A fifth attorney 
said, ""I went against him when he was a deputy DA, and I 
have been before him as a judge, and I think he has great 
judicial temperament ."" 
Intelligence/Knowledge 
Interviewees also all had very high regard for Judge 
~cCormick on knowledge of law. ""He is a really smart 
Judge. He has a vast knowledge of the law. He is extreme­
ly talented and extremely smart,"" said one. A defense 
attorney who appeared before Judge McCormick in a 
number of cases when he was assigned to a DUI court 
said, ""His intellectual grasp of the law was stellar. He 
Was very quick to pick up on"" that area of law. ""He knew McCormick 849 
it immediately ."" Three other interviewees said, ""He is 
bright,"" he has ""an extensive knowledge of the law,"" and 
he ""really is knowledgeable about criminal cases."" 
On Motions 
Criminal defense attorneys were divided in their assess­
ment of Judge McCormick's rulings <Jn motions. ""His rulings 
are very biased in favor of the prosecution, "" one defense 
attorney said. Another said that in relatively minor criminal 
cases he can show ""compassion,"" but ""in anything serious, 
whatever the cop says is true."" A third defense attorney took 
a middle ground. ""I haven't heard of him or experienced him 
extending a tremendous amount of largesse towards the 
defense. But I have noted that in a couple of cases, he has 
made a hard decision that has been for the defense. So in 
that regard, I respect him. Also, he is willing to make deci­
sions quickly."" A fourth defense attorney said that in his 
rulings, ""He is conservative, but he is fair."" 
On Trial 
One criminal defense attorney who commented about 
Judge McCormick said, ""I had a trial· with him and it was 
probably one of the worst trial experiences I have ever 
had, ever. He ruled to keep out my evidence, and I know 
he did that to another attorney I know, one that I respect 
immensely , in a murder case. He is very, very, very pro-law 
enforcement. "" The attorney added, ""It certainly is true that 
he was much more reasonable in DUI court. However, as 
a felony trial judge, he was a nightmare."" None of the other 
criminal defense attorneys who had trial experience with 
Judge McCormick seconded that dire assessment. ""I had 
a trial that took a month and I thought he was fair to my 
client,"" said one. ""I think it's a very easy court to try a case 
in. He is very low key. He lets people work. He lets people 
argue."" Another said, ""I did an extensive murder trial in his 
court. I give him two thumbs up."" Criminal defense attor­
neys were especially pleased with the way Judge McCormick 
handled DUI cases when he was assigned to that depart­
ment. ""I thought he ran the DUI court really well. I really 
liked that,"" said one. ""I know he's a former prosecutor who 
did death penalty cases, but in DUI, he was very compas­
sionate. I had him dismiss all kinds of cases. But if it's a 
serious case, I guess he's tougher. "" Another DUI defense 
attorney said, ""I had a trial with him and he called it right 
down the middle. He called it fair. I would say with him, 
though, that you had better win because if you lose, I 
wouldn't call him an easy sentencer."" A third attorney 
who represented defendants in DUI cases before Judge 
McCormick noted that ""he does the fastest sentencing west 
of the Mississippi. He speed reads the terms of probation. 
He has a script and he reads that script as fast as he can, if 
there is an attorney. If the defendant doesn't have an attor­
ney, he will take the time with them."" 
Continuances 
Attorneys who were interviewed about Judge McCormick 
had no complaints about his policy on continuances. When 
he took over the DUI court, ""he inherited a liberal con­
tinuance policy,"" and stuck with it, one interviewee said. 
Another said, ""As a trial practitioner, particularly for some­
one like me with my own practice, he is a very accommodat­
ing judge in terms of scheduling and being aware that his is 
not the only case happening at any given time."" 
Settlement 
One interviewee said Judge McCormick ""was very good"" 
at helping work out reasonable dispositions, and ""was able 
to get rid of a lot of cases"" when he took over the DUI court. 
""I had clients who wanted to hurry up and do their DUI so 
that they could go to Iraq or Afghanistan, but the military 
wouldn't accept you if you were on probation ,"" the attorney 
explained . ""So.he would figure out ways that a person could 
still do what they wanted to do, but still pay the price they 
needed to pay for their DUI."" Another interviewee said, ""Will 
he put pressure on the DA? I have never seen it, but I feel 
certain that he would· say to the DA, what are you doing 
in this case? How are you going to prove that? I think he 
would say that."" Beyond nudging prosecutors to downgrade 
weak cases, however , Judge McCormick isn't inclined to","This is a handbook for California courts and judges for the years 2013-2014, published by James Publishing. It provides information about various judges, their demeanor, intelligence, knowledge, and how they handle different aspects of their job. 

One of the judges discussed is Judge McCarville. He is generally described as having a good demeanor, with most lawyers finding him pleasant and cordial. However, one lawyer found him impatient and intimidating. His legal knowledge is considered average to excellent. He is always well-prepared and punctual, and he rules on motions in a timely manner. His courtroom management style is described as formal but comfortable, and he is generally polite to everyone. Most interviewees believe he keeps an open mind and listens to their arguments. His courtroom atmosphere is described as comfortable and professional. He is also considered fair in granting continuances based on good cause and is proactive in helping attorneys settle their cases. 

Another judge discussed is Judith Dobson McConnell, who is the Administrative Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal, Fourth District, Division One. She was appointed by Governor Davis in August 2003 and has held various judicial offices. She has also worked in private law practice and as a research attorney for the New Jersey Supreme Court. She is a member of several associations and has received numerous awards. She has also taught at various legal and judicial educational programs.

The last judge discussed is Kevin J. McCormick, a judge of the Superior Court in Sacramento County. Lawyers who have worked with him praise his demeanor and knowledge of the law. However, opinions are divided on his rulings on motions and his performance during trials. He is considered accommodating in terms of scheduling and is good at helping work out reasonable dispositions."

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE:  
 
California Court of Appeal, 1994 -2017 (Ret .). 
 
Associate Justice of the California Court of Appeal , Second 
Appellate District, Division Three, August 29, 1994 to June 30, 2017 .  
Appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson.  
 
Ventura County Superior Court, 1991 -1994.  
 
Judge of the Superior Court, County of Ventura, California, January 1991 
to August 1994.  Appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian.  
 
In 1992, Judge Aldrich was instrumental in inaugurating  Ventura 
County’s Multi -Door Courthouse .  Patterned after a 1976 concept of 
Prof. Frank Sander of the Harvard Law School, this program provides 
litigants with multiple modalities for early resolution of their disputes without trial.  These modalities 
include arbitration, mediation, settlement conferences and other procedures allowing early intervention by 
the judge to attempt to effect settlement before the expenditure of time and expense of protracted 
litigation.  This program still exists in Ventura with a success rate of over 40% settlements without trial.  
 
In 1992 Judge Aldrich was the recipient of the “Trial Judge of the Year”  award presented by the 
Ventura County Trial Lawyers Association.  
 
In 1992 and again in 1993 Judge Aldrich was selected as the “Outstanding Jurist of the Year” by the 
Ventura County Bar Association . 
 
From 1992 to 1994 Judge Aldrich  was Chair of the “Alternative Dispute Resolution  Committee”  for the 
Ventura Courts and was the founding Chair of the “Bench, Bar Media Committee” .  This committee was 
started by Judge Aldrich to promote better understanding between the judiciary, the bar and the media.  
He also chaired the “Fiscal and Budget” and  “New Legislation and Rules Committees”.  
 
In February, 1993, Judge Aldrich, who is himself disa bled, fulfilled his promise to a meeting of 
“Employment of Attorneys with Disabilities” to make California the first state in the nation to adopt a 
mechanism for persons with disabilities using California Courts to ask for and receive special 
accommodation s permitting them greater access the our courts.  In early 1993, he composed the original 
draft a measure that was adopted by the California Judicial Council in 1996 as Rule of Court 983.3, 
“Requests for accommodations by persons with disabilities.”   Earlier, largely through the efforts of 
Justice Aldrich, a similar measure was adopted by the California State Bar Board of Governors.   
 
California Court of Appeal, 1994 to 2017 . 
 
Justice Aldrich was elevated to the California Court of Appeal, Second Appellate  District, Division Three 
in 1994  where he served until his retirement, June 30, 2017 .    
 
In 1994 , Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas appointed Justice Aldrich as Chair of the  Select Committee on 
Trial Court Coordination Implementation .  The findings and recomme ndations of this “blue ribbon” 
commission were the precursor to Trial Court Unification that now exists in all counties in California.  In 
1996 , Chief Justice Lucas appointed Justice Aldrich Chair of the Business Court Study Task  Force .  
This committee was  charged with investigating the desirability and the feasibility of establishing business  
courts in California.   
 In 1995 , Justice Aldrich was instrumental in inaugurating the “Second District Appellate Settlement 
Conference and  Mediation Program.”   Under  the auspices of the Alternative Dispute Resolution 
Committee, the program has recruited experienced appellate practitioners to act as mediators and 
settlement conference officers.  As a result of this program, each year over  30% of pending appeals are 
being resolved before the time and expense of briefing and preparation of the appellate record.  
 
In 1997 , Chief Justice Ronald M. George asked Justice Aldrich to Chair the  Complex Litigation Task 
Force  for the California Judicial Council.  This task force cre ated a program to facilitate the management 
and disposition of all types of complex litigation (including complex business and tort cases) in the courts 
of California.  Under the leadership of Justice Aldrich, the Task Force published a definitive  “Deskboo k 
on the Management of Complex Civil  Cases”  which has become the model against which other similar 
programs are evaluated by other state court systems across the nation.  The Task Force formulated 
California Rules of Court and  Standards of Judicial Adminis tration  to implement complex litigation 
programs in California courts and recommended statutory changes to the legislature.  The committee also 
established 6 pilot programs in major urban centers in California including Los Angeles, Orange, San 
Francisco, Alameda, Contra Costa and Santa Clara counties.  The Task Force in conjunction with the 
Center for Judicial Education and Research  also created curricula  to instruct trial judges in the most 
advanced case management techniques available to more efficiently  handle complex civil cases.  The 
goal of this project is to better serve the public by providing a fast, efficient and economical way to resolve 
complex civil disputes.  
 
From 1998 to 2002, Justice Aldrich was appointed by the Chief Justice to the Judicial  Council of 
California . The Judicial Council is the constitutionally created governing committee of the judicial branch 
of government charged with the operation and administration of all the courts in the state of California. 
During his tenure on the Judic ial Council, Justice Aldrich served as Vice -Chair of the Policy Committee  
and he also served on the Executive Committee  and the Rules and Projects  standing committees.  
 
Justice Aldrich chaired the Judicial Council’s Civil and Small Claims Standing Advisory  Committee, 
its Case Management and Delay Reduction subcommittee.  I n 1997 and again in 2003, Justice 
Aldrich Chaired the California Judicial Administration Conference .  He chaired the Blue Ribbon 
Panel of Experts on the Fair and Efficient Administration o f Civil Cases  in 2003.  This panel brought 
consensus among many competing legal constituencies to unify delay reduction standards to allow for 
faster and more efficient resolution of civil cases in the court system.  In 2004, he chaired the Court Fees 
Work ing Group  of the Judicial Council.  This committee established uniform statewide filing fees to 
equalize and more equitably distribute filing fee revenue in each of the 58 counties in California.  
 
From  2004  to 2007 , Justice  Aldrich was chair of the Judicia l Council’s  Court Security Working Group.  
This committee is composed of representatives from the courts, the legislature, security chiefs, the State 
Sheriff’s Association, labor unions and the public.  This committee has established uniform funding 
standa rds for court security throughout the state of California.   
 
For 19 years, from 1992 to 2011, Justice Aldrich was on the faculty of the B.E. Witkin California Judicial 
College  where he t aught  “Civil Settlement Techniques.”   This was an interactive class t hat was designed 
to enable even the novice civil judge to effectively conduct civil settlement conferences.  The highlight of 
the course was an actual settlement conference conducted by Justice Aldrich in front of the class with the 
actual lawyers and prin cipals involved in the case participating.   He has also taught and lectured to 
judges and attorneys in the United States and abroad.
