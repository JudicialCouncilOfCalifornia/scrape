An appeal is a request to a higher court to review a decision made in a completed trial or proceeding. The Courts of Appeal decide questions of law and do not hear testimony or retry cases. The process involves filing a notice of appeal, submitting briefs, and hearing oral arguments. A concurrence of two out of the three justices is necessary to form a majority opinion.

After submitting the form, your account will be ready for direct deposit within 15 to 30 days. Payments are transmitted to the SCO every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and should be available to you at the beginning of the sixth business day after the JCC’s transmission.

      "Miriam Vogel was an associate justice in the California Appellate Court. She was born in Brooklyn, New York but moved to California when she was seven months old. In high school, she wanted to become an English teacher and planned to attend Santa Monica City College for two years before transferring to UCLA. Her parents, however, insisted she take typing and shorthand courses in case she needed something to fall back on. She eventually got married, quit school, and took a job as a secretary. In 1970, she found out she could get into law school if she passed an equivalency exam and scored higher than the required score on the LSAT. She worked full-time during the day and attended law school at night for four years. After graduating, she was offered a clerkship with Justice Bob Thompson and worked for him for about a year and a half. During her time there, she learned a lot about the law and how to be a hands-on judge."

      "re going to talk about it, I‘ll talk about it. [laughing] I was 15 and I had a paper route. I had a friend who was a year older than I, and he had a paper route. I was a little bit envious of him, and I thought, ―Gee, maybe I can do that.‖ So I went to the Providence Journal and I asked for a paper route. They said, ―Well, we don‘t have any, but we have a route that‘s been abandoned; it‘s a little bit bigger than what we usually give to a 15 -year-old, but if you want it, you can have it.‖ So I said, ―Sure.‖ So I had a paper route, and I had a job at a local grocery store. I worked there on Saturdays and during the summer. And then I worked at a local department store, and then I worked at a local clothing store. So I was able to pay for my college education.
