They are standards drafted to formalize the view of the members of the San Francisco Bar Association as to the level of professional conduct expected for the practice of law within the jurisdiction of the courts of the City and County of San Francisco. While litigation is largely an adversarial process and attorneys are ethically bound to zealously represent and advocate their clients' interests, certain guidelines of professional courtesy that should be observed and certain duties of professionalism that are owed by attorneys to their clients, opposing parties, opposing parties' counsel, the courts and the public as a whole.</p>\n<p>These guidelines are not meant as a substitute for other statutes and rules. None of these guidelines is intended to be a method to extend time limitations of statutes and rules including fast track time limitations without an appropriate court order. These guidelines are not meant to be exhaustive, but they are meant to set a tone or guide for conduct not specifically mentioned in these guidelines.</p>\n<p>These have been adopted by the Courts of the City and County of San Francisco as guidelines.</p>\n<h3>SECTION I. <u>NON-DISCRIMINATION</u></h3>\n<p>No attorney shall engage in any bias or discrimination based on age, gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental impairment, religion or race while litigating.</p>\n<h3>SECTION II. <u>SCHEDULING</u></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A.(1) An attorney should communicate with opposing counsel concerning the scheduling of depositions, hearings, meetings and other proceedings and make reasonable efforts to schedule such meetings, hearings, depositions and other proceedings by agreement.<br>\n(2) An attorney shall not arbitrarily or unreasonably withhold consent to a request for scheduling accommodations that do not prejudice his or her client or unduly delay a proceeding.</li>\n<li>B. An attorney should endeavor to reserve sufficient time for the completion of a hearing or deposition to permit a complete presentation or examination by counsel for all parties.</li>\n<li>C. An attorney shall not engage in delay tactics in scheduling meetings, hearings and discovery. An attorney shall not seek extensions or continuances for the purpose of harassment or solely to extend litigation.</li>\n<li>D. An attorney should notify opposing counsel, and, if apropriate, the Court and others affected of scheduling conflicts as soon as they become apparent. An attorney shall notify opposing counsel and, if appropriate, the Court or other tribunal as early as possible of any resolution between the parties that renders a scheduled hearing, deposition or meeting unnecessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SECTION III. SERVICE OF DOCUMENTS</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A. The timing and manner of service of papers should not be calculated to gain an unfair advantage, unduly burden or unnecessarily inconvenience the party receiving the papers. An attorney should not serve papers solely to take advantage of an opponent's known absence from the office or at a time or in a manner designed to inconvenience the adversary, such as late in the day (after normal business hours or on the day preceding a religious holiday), so close to a court appearance that it prohibits the ability of opposing counsel to prepare for that appearance or to respond to the papers (if permitted by law), or in such other way as would unfairly limit the other party's opportunity to respond to those papers or other matters pending in the action.</li>\n<li>B. An attorney should serve papers by personal delivery or by facsimile transmission when it is likely that service by mail, even when allowed, will prejudice the opposing party.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SECTION IV. <u>CONTINUANCES AND EXTENSIONS OF TIME</u></h3>\n<p>Consistent with existing law and court orders, an attorney should grant a reasonable request by opposing counsel for an extension of time within which to respond to a pleading, discovery, and other matters, when such an extension will not prejudice his or her client or unduly delay a proceeding.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A. An attorney shall advise his or her client that the strategy of not agreeing to reasonable requests for time extensions simply to appear \"tough\" is inappropriate.</li>\n<li>B. An attorney should not condition an agreement to an extension on extraneous terms except to preserve rights that an extension might jeopardize or seeking reciprocal scheduling concessions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SECTION V. <u>DISCOVERY</u></h3>\n<p>An attorney should only initiate discovery requests that are reasonably related to the matter at issue. An attorney shall not use discovery (i) for the purpose of harassing, embarrassing or causing the adversary to incur unnecessary expenses, as a means of delaying the timely, efficient and cost-effective resolution of a dispute; or (ii) to obtain an unfair advantage. An attorney shall avoid repetitive or argumentative questions, questions asked solely for the purposes of harassment, or questions which are known to the questioner to be an invasion of the rights of privacy of third parties not present or represented.</p>\n<p>Similarly, an attorney should ensure that responses to reasonable discovery requests are timely, complete and responsive to the discovery request. An attorney responding to written discovery should not do so in an evasive or artificial manner designed to assure that answers and responses are not truly responsive or solely to attempt to avoid a disclosure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A. <u>Depositions</u>. A deposition is to be taken as if the testimony were being given in court. An attorney shall not engage in any conduct during the deposition that would not be allowed in the presence of a judicial official.<br>\n<br>\nAn attorney representing a deponent or representing another party should limit objections to those that are well-founded and necessary for the protection of the client's interests and should not make such objections only for the purpose of argument, harassment, or delay. As most are preserved, objections need be made only when the form of the question is defective or privileged information is sought. An attorney should avoid, through objections or otherwise, improper coaching of a deponent or suggesting answers.</li>\n<li>(1) <u>Written Discovery</u>. Written discovery should not be initiated to harass or embarrass a party or witness or to impose an inordinate burden or expense in responding.<br>\n<br>\nIn responding, an attorney should not interpret the discovery in an artificially restrictive manner in an attempt to avoid disclosure. Similarly, an attorney responding to such discovery should withhold on the ground of privilege only where appropriate and should not respond in a disorganized or unintelligible fashion or in a way calculated to hide or obscure the existence of particular evidence. Similarly, an attorney should not delay responding to prevent opposing counsel from discovery prior to scheduled depositions or for any other tactical reasons.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SECTION VI. <u>MOTIONS</u></h3>\n<p>Motions should be filed sparingly, in good faith and when the issue(s) cannot be otherwise resolved. An attorney should, whenever appropriate, stipulate to all facts and legal authority not reasonably in dispute. An attorney should not engage in conduct which forces opposing counsel to file a motion and then not oppose the motion, or provide information called for in the motion only after the motion is filed.</p>\n<h3>SECTION VII. <u>DEALING WITH OPPOSING COUNSEL</u></h3>\n<p>An attorney should inform his or her client that conflicts with opposing counsel are professional and not personal, that vigorous advocacy is not inconsistent with professional courtesy, and that the conduct of counsel in litigation should not be influenced by ill feelings or anger between clients and their conduct, attitude or demeanor toward opposing attorneys. Further, an attorney should refrain from disparaging or denigrating the Court, opposing counsel, or, except in the course of appropriate examination or argument, parties, or witnesses before clients, the public, or the media.</p>\n<h3>SECTION VIII. <u>DEALING WITH THE COURT</u></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A. In a case where applicable laws or rules permit an ex parte application or communication to the Court, before making such an application or communication, an attorney should make diligent efforts to notify opposing counsel or opposing counsel known to represent or likely to represent the opposing party, should make reasonable efforts to accommodate the schedule of such attorney or party to permit the opposing party to be represented, and should avoid taking advantage of an opponent's known absence from the office.</li>\n<li>B. An attorney should not knowingly misstate, misinterpret or distort any fact or legal authority to the Court or to opposing counsel. Written materials and oral argument to the Court should accurately state current law and fairly represent the party's position without unfairly attacking the opposing counsel or opposing party.</li>\n<li>C. If, after all briefing allowed by law or the Court has been submitted, an attorney locates new authority that he or she desires to bring to the Court's attention at a hearing on the matter, a copy of such new authority shall be provided to both the Court and to all other counsel in the case at or prior to the hearing.</li>\n<li>D. An attorney for the prevailing party should draft a proposed order promptly. The order should fairly and adequately represent the rulings of the Court. When proposed orders are submitted to counsel for approval, an attorney should promptly communicate any objection to the party preparing the proposed order so that good faith discussions can be had concerning the language of the proposed order.</li>\n<li>E. An attorney should respect and abide by the spirit and the letter of all rulings of the Court.</li>\n<li>F. An attorney should be punctual in communications with others, and punctual and prepared for all scheduled appearances.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>", "parent": "https://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/general-info"},

The Court will make reasonable efforts to accommodate disability accommodation requests made less than five days before a hearing or other court appearance. </span></p>\n<p align=\"left\" dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0<span lang=\"EN\">The Court\u2019s list of certified CART providers is presented below:</span></p>\n<h3>CART Providers</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Katherine Baca<br>\n110 Gardenside #502<br>\nSF, CA 94131<br>\n(415) 279-7195<br>\n<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#04466567656f6d70707d44656b682a676b69\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"97d5f6f4f6fcfee3e3eed7f6f8fbb9f4f8fa\">[email\u00a0protected]</span></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Jane James<br>\nCaptioning Agency Professionals (CAP)<br>\n6031 Girvin Drive<br>\nOakland, CA 94611<br>\n(510) 530-3989<br>\n<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4b282a3b3f22242522252c0b2e2a393f232722252065252e3f\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"a9cac8d9ddc0c6c7c0c7cee9ccc8dbddc1c5c0c7c287c7ccdd\">[email\u00a0protected]</span></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Laura Brewer<br>\nLaura Brewer &amp; Associates<br>\n49 Lyell St.<br>\nLos Altos, CA 94022<br>\n(650) 949-1900<br>\n<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3955584c4b5879484c505a524d5c414d175a5654\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"670b061215062716120e040c13021f134904080a\">[email\u00a0protected]</span></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Teri Darrenougue<br>\nLaura Brewer &amp; Associates<br>\n49 Lyell St.<br>\nLos Altos, CA 94022<br>\n(650) 949-1900<br>\n<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d9adbcabb0a8acb0bab2adbca1ad99beb4b8b0b5f7bab6b4\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"8df9e8ffe4fcf8e4eee6f9e8f5f9cdeae0ece4e1a3eee2e0\">[email\u00a0protected]</span></a><br>\n\u00a0<br>\nRichard A.

This process includes ascertaining the individual\u2019s limitations and determining how they could be overcome with a reasonable accommodation, as well as identifying potential accommodations and assessing their effectiveness. Both the individual and the Court are required to participate in this process in good faith.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span lang=\"EN\">The Court will promptly inform the applicant of the determination to grant or deny an accommodation request. If the accommodation request is denied in whole or in part, the response will be in writing and the reason(s) will be provided in writing to the individual requesting the accommodation. Upon the request of the applicant, the Court may also provide an additional response in an alternative format. The response to the applicant will indicate whether the request for accommodation is granted or denied, in whole or in part, or an alternative accommodation is granted.</span></p>\n<p>It shall be the responsibility of each court employee to familiarize themselves with CRC <a href=\"http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=one&amp;linkid=rule1_100\" target=\"_blank\">Rule 1.100</a>, the use of <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/mc410.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Form MC 410</a> and established court procedures for processing request for accommodations.*</p>\n<p><u>Grievances and Appeals</u>:\u00a0If the Court denies your request for accommodation, you have 10 days from the date your request was denied to appeal the Court\u2019s decision.

For those who cannot afford legal representation for their children, the Court will appoint an attorney. The objectives of the Delinquency Court are to provide for the protection and safety of the public and each minor; to preserve and strengthen the minor\u2019s family ties whenever possible; give care, treatment and guidance to the minor; and hold them accountable for their behavior when they commit delinquent acts. If a minor becomes a ward of the Delinquency Court, the Court will make orders for the parents or guardians, and the minor. The minor may be allowed to live in the parents' or guardians' home under Court supervision or may be placed outside of the home in an unlocked or locked facility.

The Probate Judge appoints people and at times institutions and agencies, to act as administrators and executors of wills, as trustees, as guardians of children, and as conservators of adults who cannot handle their own affairs. The Court also supervises these matters and reviews and approves the fees that are charged. In each probate matter, the Judge must apply the law, taking into account the views of all the people involved, the evidence that has been offered and the reports prepared by staff. The Judge must consider what is fair and in the best interests of the people who are involved.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>What staff members help the Judge on my case?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>The Judge is assisted by an administrative staff, examiners and investigators, a lawyer from the Court's attorney staff, courtroom clerks, clerks who receive and process the documents filed by attorneys and the public, and by a bailiff in the courtroom. Examiners review all the petitions in the estates of deceased people, trusts, conservatorships and guardianships. They make certain that the law has been followed and that the accountings are accurate. The investigators go out into the community to see how people are doing, to inform them of their rights, and to report their circumstances, wishes, and concerns to the Judge.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>What type of Probate cases must be e-filed?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>All Probate Estate and Trust cases are subject to e-filing.

Infractions are enforced by the issuance of citations (\u201ctickets\u201d) by law enforcement. Punishment for infractions requires payment of fines and does not carry any potential jail or prison time. Failure to respond to a citation may lead to additional penalties including imposition of a $300 Civil Assessment and the notification to the Department of Motor Vehicles of your failure to appear, pursuant to Vehicle Code section 40509.5.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">If you Received a Ticket, please read this important <a href=\"/sites/default/files/images/GJ%20Imgs/Information%20Sheet%20doc%20rev%20110518_1.pdf\">Information Sheet</a>.</span></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"/sites/default/files/images/Ability%20to%20Pay%20Webpage%202020-09-15%20FJP.pdf\"><strong>Did you receive a ticket, can't afford to pay?\u00a0Learn more about your options.\u00a0</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong><u>The San Francisco Superior Court does not handle parking tickets, please contact the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.sfmta.com/\">San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency</a>.</u></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Search for Case Calendars by Case Type, plus Date OR Name or Partial Name. \u00a0Information is available up to 120 calendar days from today.</h4>\n<p class=\"button\"><a href=\"http://webapps.sftc.org/cc/CaseCalendar.dll\" target=\"_blank\">Case Calendar</a></p>\n<h3>reminder Notice</h3>\n<p>A Reminder Notice is mailed to the address listed on the citation.

Daily reporting instructions, frequently asked questions, maps, parking information, and directions to the courthouse locations are available to assist you with your service.</p>\n<p>San Francisco Superior Court has two jury assembly rooms: <em>Civic Center Courthouse, </em>400 McAllister St., Room 007 and the <em>Hall of Justice, </em>850 Bryant St., Room 307. You can reach us by phone on the Juror Information Line: (415) 551-3608.</p>\n<h3><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/divisions/jury-services/jury-reporting\">Group Reporting/Reporting Instructions</a></h3>\n<h4>\u00a0</h4>\n<h3>How Do I?</h3>\n<div class=\"accordion-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"controls\"><a class=\"expandall\" href=\"#\">expand all</a> <a class=\"collapseall\" href=\"#\">collapse all</a></div>\n\u00a0\n<div id=\"accordion\">\n<h3>Get Selected for Jury Service?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>You have been randomly selected by computer to serve as a trial juror. The selection of persons for jury service is accomplished by randomly drawing names from the list of registered voters and the Department of Motor Vehicles driver's license and identification card list for San Francisco. The law requires a fair cross-section of each county's qualified residents to be available each day for jury duty. Random summoning enhances juror impartiality. There is no attempt to deliberately inconvenience anyone.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Get exempted from jury service?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>There is no statutory exemption for any occupation except certain categories of peace officers. However, a juror may be disqualified for service for various reasons, such as citizenship, residency, or prior service within the past 12 months. A juror may also ask to be excused for various reasons, such as financial hardship or the need to provide care to another person. The postcard summons has a QR code or URL to submit a request to be excused, postponed, or disqualifed from jury service.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Reschedule my service?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>In order to accommodate your schedule, you may postpone, or reschedule, the start of your jury service once to a more convenient time. The postponement cannot exceed 6 months. You may postpone your service over the phone by calling the Jury Office at (415) 551-3608, entering your badge number (located on the back of the postcard summons), and following the instructions for postponement.\u00a0You may also postpone your service by using the QR code or URL to submit a request for postponement.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Request to be excused or disqualified?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Excuses from service may be granted in specific circumstances. If you want to request to be excused, you may submit a request online by using the QR code or URL on your postcard summons. Requests for excuse or disqualification must be received online\u00a0and cannot be accepted over the phone.\u00a0 To check on the status of your request, you may call the automated system at (415) 551-3608 and enter your badge number.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n<div class=\"accordion-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"controls\"><a class=\"expandall\" href=\"#\">expand all</a> <a class=\"collapseall\" href=\"#\">collapse all</a></div>\n\u00a0\n<div id=\"accordion2\">\n<h3>Is jury service mandatory?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>The U.S. Constitution and the California State Constitution guarantee the right to trial by jury. A\u00a0Postcard Summons is mailed to you to determine if you are qualified to serve jury duty (See Code of Civil Procedure, Section 203(a).)</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Where does the Jury Commissioner obtain names of prospective jurors?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Both the voter registration and motor vehicle records are used as source lists for prospective jurors. Names are randomly selected from the countywide population by computer. If your name and address do not match exactly in both the voter registration and motor vehicle records, you may have more than one record in the jury system. If this happens, you may receive more than one summons in a 1-year period. If you receive more than one summons in a 1-year period, please contact the Jury Office at 415-551-3608.</p>\n<p>The Court receives its data from these two sources each year in October. If you have moved out of the City recently, the Court may have still received your name from either the DMV or the Department of Elections. You must notify DMV within 10 days of your move. Registering to vote in another county does not necessarily remove your name from the SF Department of Elections rolls; you should also call the Department of Elections to tell them that you no longer live in the City.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>How many days will I have to serve?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>You may be required to appear anytime during the 5-day period of your jury service. You are required to obtain reporting instructions, by calling the Court at (415) 551-3608 or visiting the website, every day for the duration of the one week of jury service. You are required to follow your reporting instructions for every day of your service week.</p>\n<p>If you are not required to report during the 5-day period, your jury service is completed for one year.</p>\n<p>If you are asked to report and come in to the courthouse, but are not assigned to a courtroom for jury selection on the day you report, your jury service is completed for one year.</p>\n<p>If you are assigned to a courtroom for jury selection that is not completed by the end of that day, you are required to return to finish the selection for that trial.</p>\n<p>If you are selected to serve on a trial, your term of service will be the length of that trial.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>May I postpone my jury service to a more convenient time?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Yes. The Court realizes prospective jurors may be summoned at an inconvenient time and is willing to postpone service to a more convenient time. You may postpone your jury service by calling the automated system at (415) 551-3608 or by using the QR code or URL to submit a request for postponement. Jurors are entitled to a one-time postponement not to exceed 6 months from the summons date.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"floatRight\" class=\"col-xs-4 hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md\">\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"imgborder\" src=\"/sites/default/files/images/i_jurypage.jpg\" style=\"height:136px; width:205px\"></p>\n<h3>Contact Information &amp; Directions</h3>\n<p><strong>Juror Information Line</strong></p>\n<p>(415) 551-3608</p>\n<p>8:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>Monday through Friday, except Court holidays</p>\n<p><a href=\"/node/92\">Civic Center Jury Assembly Room</a><br>\nCivic Center Courthouse<br>\n400 McAllister St., Room 007<br>\nSan Francisco, CA 94102</p>\n<p><strong>Jury Assembly Room Hours:</strong></p>\n<p>8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>Monday through Friday, except Court holidays<br>\n<a href=\"/node/92\">Directions</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/node/93\">Hall of Justice Jury Assembly Room</a><br>\n850 Bryant St., Room 307<br>\nSan Francisco, CA 94103</p>\n<p><strong>Jury Assembly Room Hours:</strong></p>\n<p>8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>Monday through Friday, except Court holidays<br>\n<a href=\"/node/93\">Directions</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>", "parent": "https://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/divisions"},

A plea of either guilty or no contest means that you admit you committed the violation, and you want to pay the ticket. A plea of not guilty means you want to fight the ticket, and you will be assigned a trial date.</p>\n<h3>Traffic School</h3>\n<p>In most circumstances, you may choose to attend traffic school if you have received a ticket for a moving violation. You may attend traffic school once every 18 months. You will need to pay the ticket and a $52 administrative fee. You also will need to pay the traffic school whatever fee it charges.\u00a0The point for the moving violation will not appear on your driving record when you have successfully finished your class and paid all the charges described above. Internet traffic school also is available. If you have questions, contact the Court to confirm your eligibility.</p>\n<h3>Continuances</h3>\n<p>If you know that you will not be able to come to your first appearance arraignment, you must go to Room 145 at the <a href=\"/node/93\">Hall of Justice</a> to request a continuance. Make your request as soon as you know you won't be able to appear for your court date, at least five court days before your hearing.\u00a0Up to\u00a0a 1-month continuance will be granted from the original first appearance arraignment date. No further continuances will be allowed at the windows in Room 145.</p>\n<p>If you know that you will not be able to come to your trial date, you must go to Room 145 at the Hall of Justice to request\u00a0a continuance. Your request must be submitted at least two weeks prior to the trial date. Your request to continue a trial is not automatically granted. Unless a Judge has granted your request to continue the trial date, you are required to appear or the trial will proceed in your absence.</p>\n<p>The Court does not have extensions or continuances to pay your fine, complete traffic school or complete community service.</p>\n<h3>Trials</h3>\n<p>Be sure to be on time for your trial. If you are not present when your name is called, the Court will hear your case in your absence.\u00a0At trial, the police officer testifies first, and then you will have the chance to ask the officer questions about the ticket. You may then testify, and present any evidence you might have brought with you, including any witnesses. The\u00a0Judge\u00a0will then inform you if you have been found guilty or not guilty. You have the right to appeal if you disagree with the Judge's decision.</p>\n<h3>Options For Paying the Fine</h3>\n<p>If you plead guilty, or are found guilty by the Judge, you will be given a fine. You may pay the amount of the fine that same day or ask for time to pay.\u00a0You must pay by the date the Judge gives you; no further continuances will be granted.</p>\n<p>If you are unable to pay the fine because you are unemployed only work part-time, or receive GA, SSI or SSA, you may choose to take care of it by doing community service through <a class=\"iconArrowRight\" href=\"http://www.sfpretrial.org/about/\"><u>Project 20</u></a>.With this option, you work your fine off at the rate of $24\u00a0per hour. You may not do community service if you wish to attend traffic school and you may not do community service if you are employed full-time. If you have a finanical hardship, you may file a <a href=\"/sites/default/files/images/GJ%20Imgs/Petition-%20ATP%20rev%20103118.pdf\">Petition for Ability to Pay Determination</a> in Room 145, Window 5\u00a0at 850 Bryant St., San Francisco, CA 94103. <a href=\"https://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/divisions/traffic/cant-afford-pay\">More information about your options</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Effective August 22, 2005, a civil assessment of <strong>$300</strong> will be added to any traffic fine if you fail to post bail on time or to appear for your scheduled court date. All delinquent citations will be referred to Alliance One for collection.</p>\n<p>California law permits the Court to impose a civil assessment of up to\u00a0$300 against any individual who fails, after notice and without good cause, to appear in Court for any proceeding, or who fails to pay all or any portion of a fine ordered by the Court. The civil assessment is imposed in addition to, and separate from, any fine connected with an infraction citation.</p>\n<h3>How To Get Ready For Your Trial or Hearing</h3>\n<p>Know what you are cited for - check your ticket, or get a copy in Room 145 before you go to the courtroom.</p>\n<p>If you are charged with expired registration, bring your current registration to the Court. The same applies with insurance, change of address, or driver's license. If you have a \"fix-it\" ticket, and you have fixed the problem - headlight out, taillight out, for example - have it signed off by any police officer and bring it to the Court. If you've sold the vehicle, donated it, or had it towed, bring the sales, donation or tow documents.</p>\n<p>Photographs and/or diagrams of the area where your ticket was issued are often helpful in showing the\u00a0Judge the points you want to make.</p>\n<h3>Presenting Your Case In Court</h3>\n<p><strong>Do:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"square\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 3.4pt\">Tell the Judge what street or highway you were on, what intersection, if any, was involved, and the direction you were traveling.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 3.4pt\">Describe what happened in the order it happened. Present your best reasons first for why you think your ticket should be dismissed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 3.4pt\">Simple and to the point is best. If the Judge asks you any questions, try to answer them directly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 3.4pt\">Dress as if you are coming to a business appointment.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Don't</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"square\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 3.4pt\">Interrupt or argue with the Judge or the police officer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 3.4pt\">Repeat yourself unnecessarily.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 3.4pt\">Come into Court unprepared, without the documents you need for your case.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 3.4pt\">Bring a cell phone in to Court.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>", "parent": "https://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/divisions/traffic"},

A mental health conservatorship is different from a probate conservatorship. It is used only for people who have a psychiatric disorder so severe that it prevents them from providing for their most basic personal needs such as food, clothing, and shelter. The legal term is\u00a0gravely disabled.</p>\n<p>The purpose of mental health conservatorships is to provide individualized treatment, supervision, and living arrangements for people who are seriously mentally ill while still protecting their individual rights. Mental health conservatorships, which are sometimes called LPS conservatorships because they are governed by the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, can involve confinement in a locked psychiatric facility, which means the person is deprived of personal liberty. Therefore, there are strict legal procedures and laws that must be followed by doctors and hospitals and which involve review and monitoring by the Probate Court.</p>\n<ul class=\"square\">\n<li><a href=\"#1\"><u>Starting a Mental Health Conservatorship</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#2\"><u>Temporary Conservatorship</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#3\"><u>Hearing on Petition for General Conservatorship</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#4\"><u>After a General Conservatorship is Established</u></a></li>\n<li><u><a href=\"#5\">Other Psychiatric Proceedings in Probate Court</a></u></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"1\">Starting a Mental Health Conservatorship</a></h2>\n<p>Family members or other private parties cannot start a mental health conservatorship. Only the professional treatment staff at the hospital where the person is being treated can begin the process. The first step is to request an investigation by the Office of the Public Conservator, which is a division of the Department of Aging and Adult Services in San Francisco. If the investigation by the Public Conservator agrees with the professional staff of the psychiatric facility, the Public Conservator will formally request the Probate Court to establish a temporary mental health conservatorship and eventually, a general conservatorship. The formal request is called a petition. The person who is affected is legally called a proposed conservatee and must receive\u00a0written notice of the temporary conservatorship at least five days\u00a0before it takes place. The Probate Court also appoints an attorney, generally the Public Defender\u2019s Office, to represent the person.</p>\n<p>A temporary conservatorship cannot last longer than 30 days. At the end of 30 days, the Probate Judge considers the petition for the general conservatorship.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"2\">Temporary Conservatorship</a></h2>\n<p>During the 30-day period of temporary conservatorship, the Public Conservator is required to prepare a comprehensive written report to the Court. The report must contain all relevant aspects of the proposed conservatee\u2019s medical, psychological, financial, family, vocational and social condition, and information obtained from the person\u2019s family members, close friends, social worker or main mental health therapist. The Public Conservator also must investigate all possible alternatives to conservatorship. If the conservatorship investigation results in a recommendation for conservatorship, the Public Conservator also makes recommendations as to what specific powers should be denied to the person. The most important recommendation is whether or not the person can keep the right to give or withhold consent to psychiatric treatment, including medication. A copy of the investigator\u2019s report must be furnished to the person recommended for conservatorship.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"3\">Hearing on Petition for General Conservatorship</a></h2>\n<p>At the hearing on the petition for general conservatorship, evidence supporting the petition is presented by attorneys from the District Attorney\u2019s Office. If the person objects to the petition, a psychiatrist or psychologist must testify. The person is represented by counsel, and may testify or call others to testify. On the basis of the testimony, together with the report of the conservatorship investigator, the Judge will grant or deny the petition, or continue the proceeding to a later date. The hearings and all psychiatric records related to the proceedings are confidential.</p>\n<p>If the petition for general conservatorship is granted, the Judge will appoint a conservator and determine which, if any legal rights, will be removed from the person. The Probate Judge may order the conservator to place the conservatee in a specific setting to ensure that the placement is the least restrictive appropriate setting. In San Francisco, the powers granted to the mental health conservator are for the person only, not for assets such as bank accounts or property. A probate conservator can be appointed to handle any assets. A mental health conservatorship expires at the end of one year, but may be renewed year-by-year if the treating medical team makes a formal request to the Probate Court to continue the conservatorship and the Judge determines it is necessary. The conservatee is entitled to a full evidentiary hearing and legal representation on the renewal petition as well.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"4\">After a General Conservatorship is Established</a></h2>\n<p>During the period of the general conservatorship, the conservatee may petition the Court at any time for a hearing to challenge the conservatorship, on the basis that he or she no longer meets the legal criteria for conservatorship. The conservatee also may petition the Court for a hearing to contest any rights denied or powers granted under the conservatorship. The Court maintains ongoing supervision over the conservatorship, and frequently makes decisions as to whether the conservatee is receiving appropriate treatment in ways that are least restrictive of the personal liberty of the conservatee. The Court also makes decisions as to whether the conservatee is capable of giving or withholding consent to various forms of medical and psychiatric treatment.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"5\">Other Psychiatric Proceedings in Probate Court </a></h2>\n<p>In addition to mental health conservatorships, the Probate Court handles a range of other psychiatric proceedings, including writs of habeas corpus for persons who are civilly committed to a hospital but not on conservatorship. Other proceedings, which can be brought to the Probate Judge for a decision, include petitions to administer medical treatment to persons without a conservator, and petitions for the commitment of developmentally disabled persons to state hospitals.\u00a0The law provides that the person subject to the proceedings is provided with an attorney.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div> \n</div>\n<div id=\"floatRight\" class=\"col-xs-4 hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md\">\n<h3>Contact Us, Hours &amp; Directions</h3>\n<p>Judge Joseph M.

{"url": "https://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/node/69", "title": "Trusts", "body": "<div id=\"mainContent\" class=\"col-xs-12\">\n<div class=\"contentCenter col-xs-8\">\n<a id=\"main-content\"></a>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>A trust is a legal arrangement where someone, called a trustee, holds property for the benefit of someone else, called a beneficiary. The person who places his or her assets into the trust is called the trustor or settlor. The trust can be part of a decedent's will if the will provides that all or part of the estate is to be distributed to a trustee with directions to use the trust in specific ways.</p>\n<h3>Kinds of Trusts</h3>\n<p>There are\u00a0various kinds of trusts, including\u00a0testamentary, special needs, and living. A trust that is part of a will is called a testamentary trust. Another kind of trust is called a special needs trust which is set up to assist a disabled person who is receiving public benefits. A special needs trust can be part of a decedent's will or can be created in other ways by court order. Perhaps the most common trust is the living trust. Settlors of living trusts put their property into the trust during their lifetime, with provisions for use of the property during their lifetime and after they die. A living trust can be a useful tool for managing assets during a person's lifetime and for distribution of assets without a\u00a0probate proceeding when a person dies.</p>\n<h3>Seek the Advice of an Attorney</h3>\n<p>It is important that anyone considering a trust should talk to an attorney experienced in estate planning. Trusts are individual documents that only work well when they are correctly written to meet the specific needs of the individual trustor and his or her family. Sometimes people make trusts with unethical people who \u201ccold call\u201d them on the telephone or tell them that a trust will help avoid taxes which may not be true.</p>\n<p>There are organizations called \u201ctrust mills\u201d that telephone people, usually elders, and convince them to make trusts which may be expensive, poorly written, and not appropriate for their needs. \u201cTrust mill\u201d trusts are \u201cone size fits all\u201d documents. The elder deals with a person who says he or she is a \u201ctrust advisor.\u201d The attorney whose name is on the trust never meets the person and does not know the person\u2019s individual circumstances.</p>\n<h3>Probate Court Supervision of Trusts</h3>\n<p>Trusts come under the Probate Court\u2019s supervision for a variety of reasons. For example, special needs trusts may come before the Probate Court for determination of whether a child or incapacitated adult qualifies for this type of trust and if so who should be appointed the trustee. The Probate Court reviews periodic accountings of the special needs trustee. Living trusts although advertised as a way to avoid the Probate Court, come to the Court if the language of the trust is not clear or if a beneficiary thinks the trustee is not acting properly and the beneficiary wants a new trustee. The beneficiary can file a petition with the Probate Court asking the Court to review the trust and require the trustee to submit an accounting of how the assets have been handled.</p>\n<p>Trusts are legal arrangements created for the orderly administration of a person\u2019s assets, usually while they are still living. Consulting an experienced estate-planning attorney to prepare a trust is the safest way to be certain that this happens.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"floatRight\" class=\"col-xs-4 hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md\">\n<h3>Contact Us, Hours &amp; Directions</h3>\n<p style=\"padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-right: 0px\">Judge Joseph M.

Bills need to be paid. Because of the grief process and the effects on families when there is a death, it can be difficult to deal with the business of settling the deceased person's affairs.</p>\n<p>The process can be simple or complex depending on such factors as the size and nature of the deceased person's assets, whether assets are hard to locate, and whether the survivors can cooperate with one another. California law permits estates under $150,000 to be settled outside of the formal Probate Court process. Estates that exceed $150,000, and sometimes smaller estates for various reasons, are handled by the Probate Department.</p>\n<ul class=\"square\">\n<li><a href=\"#1\">Probate Definitions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#2\">After A Petitiion of Probate is Filed</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#3\">Duties of the Executor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#4\">Closing the Estate</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"1\">Probate Definitions</a></h2>\n<p>The person who died is called the decedent. If the decedent signed a will, the person who is designated in the will to handle the decedent's estate is called an executor. The executor files the will with the Court and files a petition for probate of the will and for appointment as the executor. If the decedent has not made a will, his or her affairs will still be settled through the Probate Court. In those cases, the person who the Court appoints to handle the estate is called an administrator. The term personal representative means either an executor or an administrator. Although the law does not require a person to have a lawyer in the Probate Court, the process is complicated and an experienced probate lawyer is most helpful.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"2\">After a Petition of Probate is Filed</a></h2>\n<p>After a petition for probate of a will and appointment of a personal representative is filed, it is set for hearing in the Probate Court. It is the responsibility of the Probate Court to determine whether the will is a valid will, who the decedent's heirs are, and whether family members and beneficiaries named in the will have been notified of the probate proceedings as required by law.\u00a0After being appointed by the Court, the executor or administrator, assisted by his or her attorney, must prepare a list of all the assets of the decedent. This is called an Inventory. The attorney then sends the Inventory to a neutral appraiser who is called a Probate Referee. The Probate Referee is a person who has been appointed by the California Controller. The Probate Referee values all\u00a0non-cash assets and returns the inventory to the attorney for filing with the Court.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"3\">Duties of the Executor</a></h2>\n<p>The executor or administrator must keep careful track of all the assets, income and expenses during the probate process and must file an accounting to the Court that is reviewed in detail by the probate examiners unless the accounting is waived by all beneficiaries or heirs. Settling the estate of a decedent can become complicated and lengthy if the estate is large or contains unusual assets, or if the Probate Court must resolve disputes. For example, the Court may have to decide which of several wills is the decedent's true wishes, or decide what the language of the will means, or decide the rights of different people to certain assets.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"4\">Closing the Estate</a></h2>\n<p>When all the assets have been collected and inventoried, property sold if necessary, all the bills and taxes paid, and any disputes resolved, the estate is ready to be closed. The executor or administrator files a petition with the Probate Court to report what he or she has done, to request a court order to distribute the assets remaining, and to request approval of fees for the executor or administrator and the attorney. State law sets the\u00a0ordinary fees for attorneys and executors or administrators according to a percentage of the value of the estate. If the executor or administrator or the attorney has done extra work, he or she can request\u00a0additional fees. The Probate Court reviews all fee requests to make sure the\u00a0ordinary fees are correctly calculated and any extra fees are reasonable. If the decedent had a will, the will specifies how the decedent wanted his or her property to be distributed. If the decedent did not make a will, the California Probate Code specifies how the estate will be distributed. The Probate Court examiners review the petition for distribution to be sure that the executor or administrator is abiding by the terms of the will if there is one, or the provision of the California Probate Code if there is no will. When all the assets have been distributed as the Court ordered, the probate proceedings are over and the executor or administrator can ask the Probate Court to be dicharged.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"floatRight\" class=\"col-xs-4 hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md\">\n<h3>Contact Us, Hours &amp; Directions</h3>\n<p style=\"padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-right: 0px\">Judge Joseph M.

In Juvenile Dependency Court cases, the child may have been removed from the home by a Child Protective Services social worker because there is information that the child is being neglected, abused, or is in danger. The child then lives in a licensed home while several court actions take place. One such action is to try and reunify the child with his or her parents. If reunification is not successful, a guardian may be appointed for the child. Relatives or friends may be appointed to serve. If appropriate, the guardianship can continue until the child turns 18. </span></span></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In Probate Court guardianships, the child usually lives with the person who is the guardian. The proposed guardian or another person in the child\u2019s life may petition the Court to establish the guardianship for a variety of reasons. The parents of the child may be unable to care for the child due to serious illness, military duty in another country, drug or alcohol addiction, incarceration, or death. Unlike Juvenile Dependency Court, the Probate Court suspends, rather than terminates parental rights. A parent, a guardian, or another person can file a petition for termination of a probate guardianship, as can a child who is 12 years-old or older. </span></span></span></p>\n<ul class=\"square\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.courts.ca.gov/1214.htm\">Guardianship of Children - Self-Help</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#2\">Probate Guardianship Process</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#3\">Guardianship Appointment Hearings</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#4\">After a Guardian has been Appointed</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Forms</h3>\n<ul class=\"square\">\n<li class=\"iconArrowRight\"><a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm/?filter=GC\">California Courts Forms/Guardianship</a></li>\n<li class=\"iconPDFRight\"><a href=\"/sites/default/files/pdfs/gc251.pdf\">GC-251 - Confidential Guardianship Status Report</a></li>\n<li class=\"iconPDFRight\"><a href=\"/sites/default/files/images/PRB-PGN-001%20Confidential%20Declaration%20of%20Proposed%20Guardian.pdf\">Declaration of Proposed Guardian</a></li>\n<li class=\"iconPDFRight\"><a href=\"/sites/default/files/images/PRB-PGN-002%20Confidential%20Request%20to%20End%20Guardianship.pdf\">Request to End Guardianship</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Guardianship of Children - Self-Help</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">If you want to ask the Court to establish the guardianship over the person of a child, you may wish to make an appointment with the <u>ACCESS Center</u> and ask for help.</span></span></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">If you already filed for guardianship of the person and need assistance with next steps, the ACCESS Center may be able to help you figure out which relatives to serve (give notice), and the paperwork you are required to send.</span></span></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">If you want to ask the Court to end a guardianship, the ACCESS Center may be able to show you how to fill out the required forms that must be filed.</span></span></span></p>\n<h2>Probate Guardianship Process</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">When a petition for probate guardianship of the person, estate, or person and estate is filed, a court investigator personally interviews the child and other significant people in the child\u2019s life. Background screenings are conducted<s> </s>on the proposed guardian and all other adults who live with the child. Once the investigation is completed, the investigator will file a confidential report for the Judge. Sometimes, a Judge will also appoint an attorney to represent the child. </span></span></span></p>\n<h2>Guardianship Appointment Hearings</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style='font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif'><span style=\"color:#333333\">When a petition for guardianship is filed, the Court Clerk will provide a court date for the hearing. Guardianship appointment hearings are held on Tuesday afternoons. All petitions for the establishment of a guardianship of the person require the proposed guardian and the proposed ward to attend the court hearing. If the petition seeks to appoint a guardian over the child\u2019s estate only, the proposed guardian must attend and the child\u2019s appearance at the appointment hearing is not required</span></span></span></span></p>\n<h2>After a Guardian has been Appointed</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0in; text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Even after a guardian has been appointed, the Probate Court continues to be concerned about the child. Every year, the Probate Court sends a blank Status Report form to the guardian along with a return envelope. Therefore, it is important for guardians to make sure the court has their current contact information. All guardians are required to fill out the annual Status Report with information about how the child is doing. When there is a guardianship of the estate, the guardian is required to account for the child\u2019s assets and is not allowed to spend any of the money in the estate without permission from the Judge.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0in; text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">All children need care and attention. Fortunately, there are people in our community who are willing to step forward and serve as guardians when a child\u2019s parents are not available. The Probate Court participates in this process by appointing guardians for children, by helping make certain that children in guardianships are protected, and by helping guardians get the information they need.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"floatRight\" class=\"col-xs-4 hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md\">\n<h3>Contact us, Hours &amp; Directions</h3>\n<p style=\"padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-right: 0px\">Judge Joseph M.

Some adults who are concerned about possible future mental and physical incapacity decide to establish a power of attorney or a trust, in part so they can avoid the court action. They choose an individual or an institution to make decisions for them if they become impaired. These are private arrangements and must be made while the person has full mental capacity. In California, courts do not routinely monitor powers of attorney or trusts. Most people do not make these arrangements probably because it is difficult to think about becoming incapacitated mentally or physically. But it happens, especially to people over 75 years of age. For those who have not made prior arrangements, or if the person handling the power of attorney or trust is incapable or dishonest, a conservatorship may become necessary.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>After a Conservatorship is Established</h2>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h4>Management of Wealth and Property</h4>\n<p>When a conservatorship is established, the Judge will require that a bond be obtained for the liquid assets and annual income in the person's estate. Liquid assets include bank accounts and stocks. A bond is like an insurance policy. If the conservator mishandles the money or takes it, the person in conservatorship can be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>The Judge also schedules the case for Court monitoring of the finances and property of the person in conservatorship as well as his or her welfare. The law requires that an Inventory and Appraisal of all assets be filed within 90 days of the appointment of the conservator. The conservator must also file a General Plan for the conservatorship. If the conservatee has any real property, the conservator must record evidence of the conservatorship with The Recorder of the City and County of San Francisco.</p>\n<h4>One Year Review</h4>\n<p>One year after the appointment of the conservator and every two years thereafter, an accounting of the assets, including the income and the expenditures must be filed with the Court. The accounting is reviewed in detail by a probate examiner. An investigator personally interviews the individual in conservatorship periodically and determines if the conservator is acting properly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Non-Family Conservators</h2>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are times when family members are unavailable or incapable of serving as conservators. Occasionally, the person who is thought to need a conservator does not want a family member to be the conservator. In those situations, there are agencies and individuals that can serve. The Public Guardian is an agency of the City and County of San Francisco and is the largest non-family conservator. There are also non-profit agencies that have complied with the law and can be appointed to serve as conservators. In addition there are individuals who are available to serve. They are called private professional conservators. As of July 1, 2008, they must be licensed by the State of California and meet ongoing educational requirements. All professional conservators are expected to keep a case and provide services even if the money runs out, especially if they have been appointed to serve as conservator of the person.</p>\n<p>All conservators and attorneys in a conservatorship case are entitled to request the Court for fees for their work. The fees are carefully reviewed and granted by the Probate Court only if they have been properly justified. Conservators and attorneys cannot take money without a formal court order.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Those Most in Need of a Conservatorship</h2>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Conservatorships affect mainly older people, especially those over 85 years of age. Coincidentally, the fastest growing age group in the United States is the one over 85 years of age. In California, that age group will increase by 143 percent between 1990 and 2020. Some counties will experience even higher rates, up to 400 percent. The influence of the 85 and older age group will emerge most strongly between 2030 and 2040 as the first of the baby boomers reaches 85 years of age (<a href=\"http://www.aging.ca.gov\">http://www.aging.ca.gov</a>). With the right genes, healthy living, and luck, most people will escape being incapacitated. However, many San Franciscans will have impairments and will need help with daily living. Most likely the number of conservatorships will increase over time.

Concerns</u>:</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">All bank account numbers and social security numbers should be redacted in documents filed with the court. \u00a0It is the duty of the parties and attorney to make sure those numbers are redacted (see CRC 1.20).</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\u00a0</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">We are seeing more motions to seal due to failure to redact the numbers. \u00a0In order for the court to grant those motions, it must make specific findings (see CRC 2.550).</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\u00a0</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The court cannot redact the numbers after the pleading has been filed nor can it extract single pages from filed documents. \u00a0The entire document must be sealed and re-filed with the redacted numbers.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">If the court does grant the motion, the order only affects the court\u2019s server. \u00a0If the document was e-filed, the attorney must also contact the e-filing service provider, alert them to the order and ask them to do whatever is necessary on their system to seal the document from public view.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div><u>Special Immigrant Juvenile Status Petitions</u>:</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">It is estimated that as many as 250 juveniles per month arrive in San

petition to find the minor eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status. \u00a0These petitions now total half of all guardianship petitions filed in San Francisco.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">This very complex area of the law continues to be the topic of robust debate among probate lawyers, judges and practitioners.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div><u>New Policy on Status Hearings for Closing Estates</u>:</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Effective immediately, if the court sets a status hearing for failure to close an estate within the statutory guidelines, an appearance at that hearing is mandatory. \u00a0Continuance requests will not be granted prior to the appearance on the assigned date.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div><u>Calendar Issues</u>:</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Due to reduced staff and the holiday season, the time delay between filing a petition and having it heard is increasing rapidly. \u00a0We expect to be back to full staff by mid-March, at which time the delay should quickly return to just about 6 weeks. \u00a0We appreciate your patience and understanding during these months.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div><u>Fees</u>:</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">For services provided on or after January 1, 2015, the court will approve rates of up to $145 per hour for

Requirements:</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>As announced at the BASF June 2014 lunch presentation, as of July 1, 2014, the clerks are only accepting petitions for filing that conform to California Rule of Court 2.111 and Local Rule 14.17.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">California Rule of Court 2.111 requires the attorney to provide his or her bar number, contact information and to properly title the case. \u00a0Remember, if you include your email address, you may get Examiner notes by email!</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\u00a0</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">Common issues that have come up under this rule:</div>\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n<li>\n<ul class=\"square\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n<li>Failure to include attorney bar number;</li>\n<li>Failure to properly name your case, e.g., using \"Jane Doe vs. Ed Smith,\" instead of \"Estate of John Doe.\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Local Rule 14.17 states that the identification must show the name and capacity of the party for whom the attorney is appearing, e.g., John Jones, Executor. \"Petitioner\" or \"Respondent\" is not sufficient.\u00a0</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\u00a0</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">Common issues that have come up under this rule are:</div>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">\n<ul class=\"square\">\n<li>Identifying the client only as \"Petitioner;\"</li>\n<li>Identifying the client only as \"Jane Doe.\"</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>Properly naming your case and identifying your client will be a great help to the filing clerks, the Examiners, and the judicial officers. \u00a0</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<h3>June 2014 Update</h3>\n<p>Welcome to the first in a series of monthly updates from the Court. Here you will find helpful information about topics trending in the Probate Department, policy changes and changes in the law. The subject of this month's update is appointment of probate referees and related notes of interest:</p>\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n<li>\n<ul class=\"square\">\n<li>We still receive requests for appointment of probate referees in probate cases. Please remember that as of January 1, 2013, probate referees are assigned on the Order for Probate.\n<ul>\n<li>The local forms <a href=\"https://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/1620%20Request%20for%20Appointment%20of%20Probate%20Referee.pdf\"><em>Request for Appointment of Probate Referee</em> </a>and <a href=\"https://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/1408%20Order%20Appointing%20Referee.pdf\"><em>Order Appointing Referee</em></a> are only needed if a referee was not appointed in the Order for Probate or if a referee is needed for some other reason (the assigned referee retired, moved to a different county, you did not get a referee assigned when you established a conservatorship, but now realize you need one, etc.).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When sending the inventory to the referee, please verify that you have the current address for that referee. The referees welcome phone calls confirming their address.\u00a0</li>\n<li>Please provide a copy of the order appointing the referee to the referee when you mail the inventory to the referee.\u00a0</li>\n<li>Do NOT amend or revise the inventory once you have received it back from the referee, even if the only change is to Attachment One. Referees are audited and their records must match the filed inventories. The referees are happy to provide you with an amended inventory upon request.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please check back next month for more updates from our office.\u00a0</p>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>", "parent": "https://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/divisions/probate"},

In addition, the title of the court must begin on line 8, which must be at or below 3 1/3 inches from the top of the page. These rules ensure each caption page will have enough space for the court\u2019s file-stamp.</p>\n<p>If smaller documents, such as exhibits, are grouped together and uploaded as one document, there must be a caption page as a cover sheet and the caption page must include a very specific document title (e.g., \u201cExhibits A-E to Declaration of Joe Smith in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment\u201d). Slip sheets must be used between each document (e.g., a page where the only words printed are \u201cExhibit A,\u201d a page where the only words printed are \u201cExhibit B\u201d and so on). Blank pages are <strong>not </strong>allowed as slip sheets.</p>\n<p>If a large document is broken down, each portion of the document that is uploaded separately must include a caption page as a cover sheet. The caption page must include a very specific document title (e.g., \u201cExhibit A to Declaration of Joe Smith in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment \u2013 Part 1 of 4\u201d).</p>\n<h4>Exhibits</h4>\n<p>Exhibits may or may not be uploaded as separate documents, depending on the situation.</p>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 40px\">\n<p><u>Proposed Orders, Stipulations &amp; Orders, Judgments and Verdicts with Exhibits </u></p>\n<p>To submit exhibits as part of a proposed order, stipulation &amp; order, judgment or verdict, you must upload everything as one document.</p>\n<p><u>All Other Types of Documents with Exhibits </u></p>\n<p>To submit exhibits as part of any other type of document (such as a declaration, appendix or request for judicial notice), it is your choice whether or not to upload the exhibits as separate documents.</p>\n<p>You may:</p>\n<ul class=\"square\">\n<li>Upload everything as one document (for example, upload a declaration with exhibits as one document);</li>\n<li>Upload each exhibit separately with its own caption page compliance with CRC\u00a72.100-2.111;</li>\n<li>Upload several small exhibits that are grouped together as one document, with its own caption page in\u00a0compliance with CRC\u00a72.100-2.111; or</li>\n<li>Break down a large exhibit into smaller portions and upload each portion as a separate document, with its own caption page in\u00a0compliance with CRC\u00a72.100-2.111.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>When one or more exhibits are appended to another document (such as a declaration) and everything is uploaded as one document, or when a group of exhibits are uploaded as one document, slip sheets must be used as exhibit tabs to delineate the exhibits (e.g., a page where the only words printed are \u201cExhibit A,\u201d a page where the only words printed are \u201cExhibit B\u201d and so on). Blank pages are not allowed as slip sheets.</p>\n<p>Each exhibit, group of exhibits or portion of an exhibit that is uploaded as a separate document must include a caption page as a cover sheet.

The Judge and staff of the San Francisco Probate Court are committed to the administration of justice with thoughtfulness and concern for the citizens of San Francisco.</span></td>\n<td align=\"center\" class=\"color2\" style=\"width: 123px;\" valign=\"middle\">\n<p class=\"buttonCenter\"><a href=\"/node/65\" target=\"_blank\">Access Now</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"one\" style=\"width: 825px;\"><a href=\"/node/196\"><strong>Real Property Court</strong></a>\n<p>Presiding Judge Katherine Feinstein created the Housing Court in November 2011 as a result of a budget-related reorganization.

Slip sheets must be used between each document (e.g., a page where the only words printed are \u201cExhibit A,\u201d a page where the only words printed are \u201cExhibit B\u201d and so on).

Dependency mediation services are free and confidential. All parties are ordered, and non-parties may be encouraged, to attend the mediation so that everyone involved in the child's life can participate in making the best plan possible for that child. <a class=\"iconArrowRight\" href=\"http://www.sfcasa.org/\">Court Appointed Special Advocates</a> (CASA) are always invited to a mediation that involves the child with whom they are working. The parties are ordered to attend mediation on a specific day and time.</p>\n<h3>What to Expect During Mediation</h3>\n<p>The mediator meets everyone in the Civic Center Courthouse, Room 402. The mediator explains how mediation works before beginning the session. Sometimes the mediator meets with everyone together. Sometimes the mediator meets with smaller groups of people. Everyone is given the opportunity to talk. The focus of the discussion is what the child needs from everyone involved. How can we make things better for the future?</p>\n<p>Children should not be brought to mediation or to Court unless the Court has specifically ordered them to appear. If children do attend the mediation the mediator will meet first with the child and his or her attorney or other support person. The child may, or may not, participate in the rest of the mediation.</p>\n<h3>What to Expect After Mediation</h3>\n<p>At the end of the mediation session, the mediator will write up the parties' agreement so that it can be presented to the Court. The parties go directly from the mediation session to the courtroom. The parties will present their agreement to the Court and request that it be made a Court order. If there is no agreement, the Court will schedule a hearing date to deal with any issues not resolved during the mediation.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"floatRight\" class=\"col-xs-4 hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md\">\n<h3>Contact Us and Directions</h3>\n<p><strong>Supervising Judge\u00a0Monica F.

It hears cases about children who are abused or neglected. The law states that the Juvenile Dependency Court must protect the children in juvenile court. Read the laws for this court: <a href=\"http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=wic&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=300-304.7\">Welfare and Institutions Code sections 300</a>.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>The Court tries to keep children with their families and make the families stronger. The Court will take a child from the parents if necessary for the child's well being and safety. If the Court takes a child from the home, the Court will work with the family and the child to improve the home conditions so the child can move back home. If the Court takes a child away from the family, the Court will make sure that someone has custody of the child. The children will get the care and discipline they need to be safe and protected.\u00a0</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<h3>important links</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/sites/default/files/images/Announcement%20of%20Dependency%20Emergency%20Operations%20%282nd%20revision%20-%2003-24-20%29%20%282%29_0.pdf\">ANNOUNCEMENT OF EMERGENCY DEPENDENCY COURT OPERATIONS, EFFECTIVE MARCH 24, 2020</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/divisions/ufc/juvenile-case-transfers\">Juvenile Case Transfers</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/sites/default/files/images/Dependency%20Calendar%20Revised%2009.2016.pdf\">Juvenile Dependency Department Calendars</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/sites/default/files/images/LRSF%2012_Final%2001012017.pdf\">Local Rule of Court - Juvenile Dependency\u00a0(Rule 12)</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/forms-filing/forms\">Juvenile Dependency Local Forms</a>\u00a0(scoll down to locate forms for the Juvenile Dependency Court)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"floatRight\" class=\"col-xs-4 hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md\">\n<h3>Contact information</h3>\n<p><strong>Supervising Judge<br>\nMonica F.

After your papers have been prepared and reviewed by the Facilitator's Office, they must be filed in Room 402. You will be assigned a Monday morning hearing date. This court date is called the Readiness Calendar. Your filed papers must be properly served on the other party in the timeframe required by law. The proof of service should be filed with the Court before the hearing date. You should always keep copies of all of your court paperwork.</p>\n<p>Cases that include a dispute over custody or visitation are set on the Monday morning Readiness Calendar. When cases are called, the Court orders the parties to orientation immediately following the calendar call (the orientation is from 9:30 a.m. to 12 p.m.). You also will be given the dates for a mediation session and a court hearing date before you leave the courtroom for orientation.</p>\n<p>Cases that include a request for a restraining order, in addition to custody and visitation issues, are set on Wednesdays. The parties proceed from Court to separate 1-hour orientations. Immediately after the orientation, the parties meet with a mediator, one at a time, to work out a parenting plan. The mediation session does not address the restraining order request. That issue will be dealt with after the mediation when the parties return to Court for a short hearing. (See <a href=\"/node/82\">Family Court Services</a> for more information related to mediation services).</p>\n</div>\n<h3>What should I bring to my court hearing?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>You should bring a list of all the things you want the Court to order. You should also bring any papers that will show the Court that it should order what you want. For example, if you don't want your child to spend the night before school with his or her other parent because your child is late to school on the days following overnights, bring in a signed paper from the school that shows your child's absence or tardiness on those days.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Can I talk at the court hearing?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>If you do not have an attorney, the Court is counting on you to act as your own attorney. The Court needs you to say what you're requesting and why. This is why it's a good idea to write down your ideas so you don't forget anything. The Court will want you to describe your request and to present any evidence you have as quickly as possible. Always talk directly to the Judge. You should never talk directly to your child's other parent or his or her attorney.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>When are other Family Law matters heard?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Requests for Orders and Orders to Show Cause that do not include requests for custody and/or visitation are heard on the 9 a.m. short cause hearing calendar on Tuesdays and Thursdays in Departments 403 and 404. Parties are limited to a total of 20 minutes for their hearing. Requests for Restraining Orders when the parties have children together are heard on Wednesdays at 8:30 a.m. in Departments 403 and 404. Requests for Restraining Orders when the parties do not have children together are heard on Fridays at 9 a.m. in Department 404.</p>\n<p>Mandatory Settlement Conferences are scheduled every Friday morning.</p>\n<p>Status Conferences are on Monday mornings at 10 a.m. in Departments 403 and 404.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>How do I calendar a matter that doesn't involve custody or visitation issues?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Law and motion matters and orders to show cause may be put on the 9 a.m. calendar in the appropriate department on Tuesdays or Thursdays only. These are short cause hearing calendars and parties may not exceed a total of 20 minutes for their hearing. Please select one of these days and put the date on your order to show cause or notice of motion. The clerk will try to accommodate the date as court time allows.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in how crowded the court calendar is, or to find out if the Judge is available on a certain date, contact the calendar clerk at (415) 551-3906.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>How do I have both custody and financial issues heard on the same day?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>You may file your Request for Order for both custody and financial issues together. The Court may hear the financial issues on the same day as the custody issue if time permits. Otherwise, the custody matters will be given priority.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>How do I calendar an adoption proceeding?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>All adoptions are heard on Monday morning at 8:45 a.m. in Department 405.

The Coordinator can be reached at (415) 551-3900.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>How do I get a copy of a transcript?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Due to state budget cuts, Official Court Reporters will only be provided by the Unified Family Court at the following calendars: Family Law &amp; Motion; Domestic Violence Calendars; Domestic Violence and Contempt Long Cause matters; Self-Represented Litigants Law &amp; Motion calendar; All Child Support matters in department 416; and all Dependency matters. Official Court Reporters will not normally be provided by the Court for Family Law Long Cause hearings or trials. To obtain a transcript, call the Department in which the matter was heard and ask the Clerk who the Court Reporter was on a given date. The Clerk will put you in touch with the correct reporter. If the Clerk is unable to provide you with the Court Reporter's name, call (415) 551-3778. Requests for transcripts also may be made by email at <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"3f4b4d5e514c5c4d564f4b4d5a4e4a5a4c4b4c7f4c594b5c11504d5811\">[email\u00a0protected]</a></p>\n</div>\n<h3>Why won't the courtroom clerk help me?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Superior Court staff are not permitted, under state law, to give legal advice.

In all cases, the Department can help you recover child support payments once the Court has made an order for payment. The Department also can help file papers related to the paternity of a child.

Mediators are highly trained neutrals who assist parties in creating plans that best serve the needs of their children. In family law cases, mediators assist parents in making their own plans for their children by keeping the focus on the children's needs, the safety of all involved and helping to establish better communication between the parents. These mediation sessions are generally two hours in length.</p>\n<p>In juvenile dependency cases, mediators assist the parties in working out a plan that best supports the child's needs. Parents, social workers, all involved attorneys, and other participants invited by the Court or the parties, participate in the mediation. Orientation takes place at the time of the mediation session, which is generally 2 \u00bd- to 3-hours long. At the end of the mediation session the parties report directly back to the Court and request that the Court make their agreement an order or set a date for a hearing if no agreement is reached. Please go to the <a href=\"http://207.215.212.59/divisions/ufc/dependency\" target=\"_blank\">Juvenile Dependency</a> for more information on mediations in Juvenile cases.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>What if I don't attend orientation?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Attendance at orientation is mandatory. It must be completed before your mediation date or the mediation cannot proceed. This is required by order of the Court. If you fail to attend orientation and/or mediation you can be fined by the Court for your failure to follow a court order. The Court also may make orders against your interests if you do not appear at the hearing.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>How do I get an appointment with a mediator?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>In most cases you will be automatically scheduled for mediation on the first day you are ordered to come to Court. If you have been to mediation in the past, you will generally be assigned to the same mediator.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>What if I want to set up a mediation without having to go through the Court?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>If you have not been to mediation in the last two years and both you and your child's other parent agree to return to mediation, you may fill out and sign a form called Stipulation for Voluntary Mediation. After both parents have signed the completed form, it should be brought to a window clerk in Room 402 or be faxed to the supervising mediator at (415) 551-4002. Once the completed form is received, a mediator will contact each party to schedule a Monday morning orientation and a mediation date. You should be sure to include contact information for yourself and your child's other parent so that the assigned mediator can contact you to set up the appointment.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Should I bring my child to mediation?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Children are not allowed in mediation or Court, unless specifically requested by the Court. Children should not be involved in the Court process. They should be shielded from the adult issues being discussed at Court and should be encouraged to participate in their normal activities; going to school, seeing their friends, and participating in fun activities.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>What can I do to prepare myself for mediation?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Do whatever you can to separate your feelings about your child's well-being from what your child needs from that parent. Take into consideration the things discussed during orientation about what children need from their parents and others at different ages. Bring at least two different proposals about how your child can spend time with you and his or her other parent. Be prepared to listen to your child's other parent's ideas so that the two of you can have a discussion about what might work for everyone.</p>\n<p>Make a list of any specific concerns about your child's other parent so that they can be addressed in putting together the plan for your child.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>What if I need to contact my mediator but can't remember who it is or don't have their phone number?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>You can call (415) 551-4007 for information about how to contact your mediator.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>What if my mediator is no longer working at Family Court Services?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>If you need assistance from a mediator and your mediator is no longer available you should call the manager.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>What if I'm afraid of my child's other parent and we're going to mediation?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Anyone who has had a history of violence or intimidation with their child's other parent has the right to meet with the mediator without the other parent being present. You also have the right to bring a person with you who makes you feel more comfortable (a support person). The support person may sit with you in the mediation session but is not allowed to speak. The support person can be asked to leave if he or she causes a disruption or breaks the rules of the mediation session. In some situations, the mediator can meet with each parent on separate days or at different times of the day so that they are not both at the courthouse at the same time.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>How will the mediator know that I'm afraid of the other parent?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>When you go to orientation everyone will fill out a form that asks questions about any violence between you and your child's other parent. Your mediator will get this form before your mediation session and will know about your situation.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>What is the domestic violence calendar?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Every Wednesday the Court schedules hearings for only those people who are requesting restraining orders. Parents who have children in common are seen first at 9 a.m. After the Court calls all of the cases, parents will immediately be escorted to separate orientations.</p>\n<p>After orientation the mediator will meet first with the parent requesting the restraining order and then meet separately with the other parent. The parents are never in the same room except for when they are in Court. The mediator assists parents in making arrangements for their children to spend time with both parents in a way that is safe for everyone. The mediation discussion is focused on the children and does not address the restraining order itself.</p>\n<p>As in any mediation, there is no pressure to agree. After mediation, both parents go back to Court so that the Court can make a decision about whether or not to grant the restraining order and to make parenting plan orders if the parents could not come up with their own plan.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Do I need an attorney?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>This is a personal and, often, a financial decision. Many people represent themselves. The Court's <a href=\"http://207.215.212.59/self-help\">ACCESS Center</a> can help with paperwork and the Bar Association of San Francisco Lawyer Referral line can help make referrals for low cost attorneys (415) 989-1616.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Can my attorney come to mediation?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Yes, your attorney may participate in the mediation session. However, the mediator generally meets first with the lawyers and then spends most of the mediation session meeting with only the parents. Your lawyer may wait for you to finish your discussion so that you can discuss any questions you might have or you and your attorney can decide that you call him or her with questions as they come up during the mediation.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>What is a Tier 2?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>The Court may want more information before it makes final decisions about custody or visitation orders. The Court can order Family Court Services to get information from various sources and to write a report about the information obtained from these sources. A Tier 2 may include interviewing parents and/or children but generally involves talking with schools, therapists and other people involved in the child's life. Parents receive a copy of the Tier 2 report prior to the next Court hearing date.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>", "parent": "https://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/divisions/ufc"},

Bills need to be paid. Because of the grief process and the effects on families when there is a death, it can be difficult to deal with the business of settling the deceased person's affairs.</p>\n<p>The process can be simple or complex depending on such factors as the size and nature of the deceased person's assets, whether assets are hard to locate, and whether the survivors can cooperate with one another. California law permits estates under $150,000 to be settled outside of the formal Probate Court process. Estates that exceed $150,000, and sometimes smaller estates for various reasons, are handled by the Probate Department.</p>\n<ul class=\"square\">\n<li><a href=\"#1\">Probate Definitions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#2\">After A Petitiion of Probate is Filed</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#3\">Duties of the Executor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#4\">Closing the Estate</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"1\">Probate Definitions</a></h2>\n<p>The person who died is called the decedent. If the decedent signed a will, the person who is designated in the will to handle the decedent's estate is called an executor. The executor files the will with the Court and files a petition for probate of the will and for appointment as the executor. If the decedent has not made a will, his or her affairs will still be settled through the Probate Court. In those cases, the person who the Court appoints to handle the estate is called an administrator. The term personal representative means either an executor or an administrator. Although the law does not require a person to have a lawyer in the Probate Court, the process is complicated and an experienced probate lawyer is most helpful.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"2\">After a Petition of Probate is Filed</a></h2>\n<p>After a petition for probate of a will and appointment of a personal representative is filed, it is set for hearing in the Probate Court. It is the responsibility of the Probate Court to determine whether the will is a valid will, who the decedent's heirs are, and whether family members and beneficiaries named in the will have been notified of the probate proceedings as required by law.\u00a0After being appointed by the Court, the executor or administrator, assisted by his or her attorney, must prepare a list of all the assets of the decedent. This is called an Inventory. The attorney then sends the Inventory to a neutral appraiser who is called a Probate Referee. The Probate Referee is a person who has been appointed by the California Controller. The Probate Referee values all\u00a0non-cash assets and returns the inventory to the attorney for filing with the Court.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"3\">Duties of the Executor</a></h2>\n<p>The executor or administrator must keep careful track of all the assets, income and expenses during the probate process and must file an accounting to the Court that is reviewed in detail by the probate examiners unless the accounting is waived by all beneficiaries or heirs. Settling the estate of a decedent can become complicated and lengthy if the estate is large or contains unusual assets, or if the Probate Court must resolve disputes. For example, the Court may have to decide which of several wills is the decedent's true wishes, or decide what the language of the will means, or decide the rights of different people to certain assets.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"4\">Closing the Estate</a></h2>\n<p>When all the assets have been collected and inventoried, property sold if necessary, all the bills and taxes paid, and any disputes resolved, the estate is ready to be closed. The executor or administrator files a petition with the Probate Court to report what he or she has done, to request a court order to distribute the assets remaining, and to request approval of fees for the executor or administrator and the attorney. State law sets the\u00a0ordinary fees for attorneys and executors or administrators according to a percentage of the value of the estate. If the executor or administrator or the attorney has done extra work, he or she can request\u00a0additional fees. The Probate Court reviews all fee requests to make sure the\u00a0ordinary fees are correctly calculated and any extra fees are reasonable. If the decedent had a will, the will specifies how the decedent wanted his or her property to be distributed. If the decedent did not make a will, the California Probate Code specifies how the estate will be distributed. The Probate Court examiners review the petition for distribution to be sure that the executor or administrator is abiding by the terms of the will if there is one, or the provision of the California Probate Code if there is no will. When all the assets have been distributed as the Court ordered, the probate proceedings are over and the executor or administrator can ask the Probate Court to be dicharged.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"floatRight\" class=\"col-xs-4 hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md\">\n<h3>Contact Us, Hours &amp; Directions</h3>\n<p style=\"padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-right: 0px\">Judge Joseph M.

The person who places his or her assets into the trust is called the trustor or settlor. The trust can be part of a decedent's will if the will provides that all or part of the estate is to be distributed to a trustee with directions to use the trust in specific ways.</p>\n<h3>Kinds of Trusts</h3>\n<p>There are\u00a0various kinds of trusts, including\u00a0testamentary, special needs, and living. A trust that is part of a will is called a testamentary trust. Another kind of trust is called a special needs trust which is set up to assist a disabled person who is receiving public benefits. A special needs trust can be part of a decedent's will or can be created in other ways by court order. Perhaps the most common trust is the living trust. Settlors of living trusts put their property into the trust during their lifetime, with provisions for use of the property during their lifetime and after they die. A living trust can be a useful tool for managing assets during a person's lifetime and for distribution of assets without a\u00a0probate proceeding when a person dies.</p>\n<h3>Seek the Advice of an Attorney</h3>\n<p>It is important that anyone considering a trust should talk to an attorney experienced in estate planning. Trusts are individual documents that only work well when they are correctly written to meet the specific needs of the individual trustor and his or her family. Sometimes people make trusts with unethical people who \u201ccold call\u201d them on the telephone or tell them that a trust will help avoid taxes which may not be true.</p>\n<p>There are organizations called \u201ctrust mills\u201d that telephone people, usually elders, and convince them to make trusts which may be expensive, poorly written, and not appropriate for their needs. \u201cTrust mill\u201d trusts are \u201cone size fits all\u201d documents. The elder deals with a person who says he or she is a \u201ctrust advisor.\u201d The attorney whose name is on the trust never meets the person and does not know the person\u2019s individual circumstances.</p>\n<h3>Probate Court Supervision of Trusts</h3>\n<p>Trusts come under the Probate Court\u2019s supervision for a variety of reasons. For example, special needs trusts may come before the Probate Court for determination of whether a child or incapacitated adult qualifies for this type of trust and if so who should be appointed the trustee. The Probate Court reviews periodic accountings of the special needs trustee. Living trusts although advertised as a way to avoid the Probate Court, come to the Court if the language of the trust is not clear or if a beneficiary thinks the trustee is not acting properly and the beneficiary wants a new trustee. The beneficiary can file a petition with the Probate Court asking the Court to review the trust and require the trustee to submit an accounting of how the assets have been handled.</p>\n<p>Trusts are legal arrangements created for the orderly administration of a person\u2019s assets, usually while they are still living. Consulting an experienced estate-planning attorney to prepare a trust is the safest way to be certain that this happens.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"floatRight\" class=\"col-xs-4 hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md\">\n<h3>Contact Us, Hours &amp; Directions</h3>\n<p style=\"padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-right: 0px\">Judge Joseph M.

A mental health conservatorship is different from a probate conservatorship. It is used only for people who have a psychiatric disorder so severe that it prevents them from providing for their most basic personal needs such as food, clothing, and shelter. The legal term is\u00a0gravely disabled.</p>\n<p>The purpose of mental health conservatorships is to provide individualized treatment, supervision, and living arrangements for people who are seriously mentally ill while still protecting their individual rights. Mental health conservatorships, which are sometimes called LPS conservatorships because they are governed by the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, can involve confinement in a locked psychiatric facility, which means the person is deprived of personal liberty. Therefore, there are strict legal procedures and laws that must be followed by doctors and hospitals and which involve review and monitoring by the Probate Court.</p>\n<ul class=\"square\">\n<li><a href=\"#1\"><u>Starting a Mental Health Conservatorship</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#2\"><u>Temporary Conservatorship</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#3\"><u>Hearing on Petition for General Conservatorship</u></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#4\"><u>After a General Conservatorship is Established</u></a></li>\n<li><u><a href=\"#5\">Other Psychiatric Proceedings in Probate Court</a></u></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"1\">Starting a Mental Health Conservatorship</a></h2>\n<p>Family members or other private parties cannot start a mental health conservatorship. Only the professional treatment staff at the hospital where the person is being treated can begin the process. The first step is to request an investigation by the Office of the Public Conservator, which is a division of the Department of Aging and Adult Services in San Francisco. If the investigation by the Public Conservator agrees with the professional staff of the psychiatric facility, the Public Conservator will formally request the Probate Court to establish a temporary mental health conservatorship and eventually, a general conservatorship. The formal request is called a petition. The person who is affected is legally called a proposed conservatee and must receive\u00a0written notice of the temporary conservatorship at least five days\u00a0before it takes place. The Probate Court also appoints an attorney, generally the Public Defender\u2019s Office, to represent the person.</p>\n<p>A temporary conservatorship cannot last longer than 30 days. At the end of 30 days, the Probate Judge considers the petition for the general conservatorship.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"2\">Temporary Conservatorship</a></h2>\n<p>During the 30-day period of temporary conservatorship, the Public Conservator is required to prepare a comprehensive written report to the Court. The report must contain all relevant aspects of the proposed conservatee\u2019s medical, psychological, financial, family, vocational and social condition, and information obtained from the person\u2019s family members, close friends, social worker or main mental health therapist. The Public Conservator also must investigate all possible alternatives to conservatorship. If the conservatorship investigation results in a recommendation for conservatorship, the Public Conservator also makes recommendations as to what specific powers should be denied to the person. The most important recommendation is whether or not the person can keep the right to give or withhold consent to psychiatric treatment, including medication. A copy of the investigator\u2019s report must be furnished to the person recommended for conservatorship.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"3\">Hearing on Petition for General Conservatorship</a></h2>\n<p>At the hearing on the petition for general conservatorship, evidence supporting the petition is presented by attorneys from the District Attorney\u2019s Office. If the person objects to the petition, a psychiatrist or psychologist must testify. The person is represented by counsel, and may testify or call others to testify. On the basis of the testimony, together with the report of the conservatorship investigator, the Judge will grant or deny the petition, or continue the proceeding to a later date. The hearings and all psychiatric records related to the proceedings are confidential.</p>\n<p>If the petition for general conservatorship is granted, the Judge will appoint a conservator and determine which, if any legal rights, will be removed from the person. The Probate Judge may order the conservator to place the conservatee in a specific setting to ensure that the placement is the least restrictive appropriate setting. In San Francisco, the powers granted to the mental health conservator are for the person only, not for assets such as bank accounts or property. A probate conservator can be appointed to handle any assets. A mental health conservatorship expires at the end of one year, but may be renewed year-by-year if the treating medical team makes a formal request to the Probate Court to continue the conservatorship and the Judge determines it is necessary. The conservatee is entitled to a full evidentiary hearing and legal representation on the renewal petition as well.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"4\">After a General Conservatorship is Established</a></h2>\n<p>During the period of the general conservatorship, the conservatee may petition the Court at any time for a hearing to challenge the conservatorship, on the basis that he or she no longer meets the legal criteria for conservatorship. The conservatee also may petition the Court for a hearing to contest any rights denied or powers granted under the conservatorship. The Court maintains ongoing supervision over the conservatorship, and frequently makes decisions as to whether the conservatee is receiving appropriate treatment in ways that are least restrictive of the personal liberty of the conservatee. The Court also makes decisions as to whether the conservatee is capable of giving or withholding consent to various forms of medical and psychiatric treatment.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"5\">Other Psychiatric Proceedings in Probate Court </a></h2>\n<p>In addition to mental health conservatorships, the Probate Court handles a range of other psychiatric proceedings, including writs of habeas corpus for persons who are civilly committed to a hospital but not on conservatorship. Other proceedings, which can be brought to the Probate Judge for a decision, include petitions to administer medical treatment to persons without a conservator, and petitions for the commitment of developmentally disabled persons to state hospitals.\u00a0The law provides that the person subject to the proceedings is provided with an attorney.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"floatRight\" class=\"col-xs-4 hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md\">\n<h3>Contact Us, Hours &amp; Directions</h3>\n<p>Judge Joseph M.

Its function is to investigate the operations of the various officers, departments and agencies of the government of the City and County of San Francisco. Each Civil Grand Jury determines which officers, departments and agencies it will investigate during its term of office.</p>\n<dl class=\"faq\">\n<dt>What Is The Grand Jury?</dt>\n<dd>The Civil Grand Jury is comprised of 19 members who serve for a period of one year, from July through June 30 the following year, and are selected at random from a pool of 30 prospective grand jurors. During the term, grand jurors serve a minimum of approximately 500 hours. <a href=\"/node/191\">MORE \u00bb</a></dd>\n<dt>How does it work?</dt>\n<dd>Each jury determines which issues related to the governance of San Francisco City &amp; County it wishes to investigate. Juries are free to choose their methodology. In recent years the usual practice has been to divide into committees, which then select the county's officers, departments or agencies they will investigate. State law authorizes civil grand juries, as representatives of the local citizenry, to review and evaluate the effectiveness and cost/benefit of procedures, methods and systems.</dd>\n<dt>What Does The Grand Jury Do?</dt>\n<dd>During their investigations, jurors may inspect and audit books, records and financial expenditures; interview civil servants and others who may have pertinent information; inspect government facilities, and then issue reports with findings and recommendations. After the Presiding Judge reviews these reports to make certain they meet legal requirements, they are sent to the appropriate department heads, who are required by law to respond. When they agree, they must specify how and when they will implement the recommended changes; if they disagree, they must explain their reasons. The jury then releases the reports to the public via the media and the Board of Supervisors, which generally holds public hearings on each year's reports.</dd>\n<dt>When Does the Civil Grand Jury Meet?</dt>\n<dd>The jury typically meets weekly on Monday evenings from 5:30 to 7:30. Meetings take place at the Civic Center Courthouse located at 400 McAllister St., San Francisco. Most committee work takes place during regular working hours.\n<dl class=\"faq\" style=\"padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; clear: both; padding-top: 5px\">\n</dl>\n</dd>\n<dt>What are the Eligibility Requirements?</dt>\n<dd>Grand Jury eligibility includes: US citizenship, minimum age of 18, residency in the City &amp; County for at least one year, ordinary intelligence, good character and a working knowledge of English. (Persons are ineligible to serve if they have been discharged from the grand jury within one year, are currently serving on a trial jury, are elected public officials, or have been convicted of a felony.) Jurors must by law disclose all investments and business positions in and/or income from any entity that has conducted business within the City &amp; County in the previous two years, as well as income from all employees of the City and County and all interests in real property. These become matters of public record.</dd>\n<dt>Register a Complaint or Concern with the Grand Jury?</dt>\n<dt>\u00a0</dt>\n<dt>All communications with the Civil Grand Jury are completely confidential, as are all its investigations. The Civil Grand Jury is charged by Superior Court with investigating the operations of the various officers, departments, bureaus and agencies of the government of the City and County of San Francisco.

After your papers have been prepared and reviewed by the Facilitator's Office, they must be filed in Room 402. You will be assigned a Monday morning hearing date. This court date is called the Readiness Calendar. Your filed papers must be properly served on the other party in the timeframe required by law. The proof of service should be filed with the Court before the hearing date. You should always keep copies of all of your court paperwork.</p>\n<p>Cases that include a dispute over custody or visitation are set on the Monday morning Readiness Calendar. When cases are called, the Court orders the parties to orientation immediately following the calendar call (the orientation is from 9:30 a.m. to 12 p.m.). You also will be given the dates for a mediation session and a court hearing date before you leave the courtroom for orientation.</p>\n<p>Cases that include a request for a restraining order, in addition to custody and visitation issues, are set on Wednesdays. The parties proceed from Court to separate 1-hour orientations. Immediately after the orientation, the parties meet with a mediator, one at a time, to work out a parenting plan. The mediation session does not address the restraining order request. That issue will be dealt with after the mediation when the parties return to Court for a short hearing. (See <a href=\"/node/82\">Family Court Services</a> for more information related to mediation services).</p>\n</div>\n<h3>What should I bring to my court hearing?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>You should bring a list of all the things you want the Court to order. You should also bring any papers that will show the Court that it should order what you want. For example, if you don't want your child to spend the night before school with his or her other parent because your child is late to school on the days following overnights, bring in a signed paper from the school that shows your child's absence or tardiness on those days.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Can I talk at the court hearing?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>If you do not have an attorney, the Court is counting on you to act as your own attorney. The Court needs you to say what you're requesting and why. This is why it's a good idea to write down your ideas so you don't forget anything. The Court will want you to describe your request and to present any evidence you have as quickly as possible. Always talk directly to the Judge. You should never talk directly to your child's other parent or his or her attorney.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>When are other Family Law matters heard?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Requests for Orders and Orders to Show Cause that do not include requests for custody and/or visitation are heard on the 9 a.m. short cause hearing calendar on Tuesdays and Thursdays in Departments 403 and 404. Parties are limited to a total of 20 minutes for their hearing. Requests for Restraining Orders when the parties have children together are heard on Wednesdays at 8:30 a.m. in Departments 403 and 404. Requests for Restraining Orders when the parties do not have children together are heard on Fridays at 9 a.m. in Department 404.</p>\n<p>Mandatory Settlement Conferences are scheduled every Friday morning.</p>\n<p>Status Conferences are on Monday mornings at 10 a.m. in Departments 403 and 404.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>How do I calendar a matter that doesn't involve custody or visitation issues?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Law and motion matters and orders to show cause may be put on the 9 a.m. calendar in the appropriate department on Tuesdays or Thursdays only. These are short cause hearing calendars and parties may not exceed a total of 20 minutes for their hearing. Please select one of these days and put the date on your order to show cause or notice of motion. The clerk will try to accommodate the date as court time allows.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in how crowded the court calendar is, or to find out if the Judge is available on a certain date, contact the calendar clerk at (415) 551-3906.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>How do I have both custody and financial issues heard on the same day?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>You may file your Request for Order for both custody and financial issues together. The Court may hear the financial issues on the same day as the custody issue if time permits. Otherwise, the custody matters will be given priority.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>How do I calendar an adoption proceeding?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>All adoptions are heard on Monday morning at 8:45 a.m. in Department 405. The calendar is maintained exclusively by the Adoptions Coordinator. No adoption will be calendared until copies of the decree of adoption, the consent and agreement, and the accounting report have been lodged with the Adoptions Coordinator. The Coordinator can be reached at (415) 551-3900.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>How do I get a copy of a transcript?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Due to state budget cuts, Official Court Reporters will only be provided by the Unified Family Court at the following calendars: Family Law &amp; Motion; Domestic Violence Calendars; Domestic Violence and Contempt Long Cause matters; Self-Represented Litigants Law &amp; Motion calendar; All Child Support matters in department 416; and all Dependency matters. Official Court Reporters will not normally be provided by the Court for Family Law Long Cause hearings or trials. To obtain a transcript, call the Department in which the matter was heard and ask the Clerk who the Court Reporter was on a given date. The Clerk will put you in touch with the correct reporter. If the Clerk is unable to provide you with the Court Reporter's name, call (415) 551-3778.

You can call the Bar Association of San Francisco Lawyer Referral line at (415) 989-1616 for a possible referral. Please consult the Family Law Facilitator and the <a href=\"/node/43\">Family Law Self-Help Center</a> for other services to help you.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Is there help to get my papers filled out properly?</h3>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"/node/43\">The Family Law Facilitator and Family Law Self-Help Center</a> is located in Room 509 of the Civic Center Courthouse. They will help you put together your own paperwork and will tell you what you do after you've finished the paperwork. The Family Law Facilitator services are free and are available in English and Spanish. The Family Law Facilitator does not give legal advice but will help guide you through the paperwork necessary to get into Court. You can contact the Family Law Facilitator at (415) 551-3991 for information on when you can be seen by them.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Where can I get information about child support payments?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>In many cases the <a href=\"http://www.childsup.ca.gov/Home/tabid/36/Default.aspx\">Department of Child Support Services</a> can help you bring a request for child support to Court. In all cases, the Department can help you recover child support payments once the Court has made an order for payment. The Department also can help file papers related to the paternity of a child. You can reach the Department at (415) 356-2700 at the Mission Office. If your zip code is 94124 or 94134, call (415) 550-3500 for the Bayview Office.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Who can I call if I suspect child abuse?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>If a child is in need of immediate help you should dial 911. If you want to make a child abuse report for investigation, call (415) 558-2650 or 1-800-856-5553. If the abuse is not in San Francisco, call that county's Child Emergency Services. You can get the phone number by calling information in that county.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>What are the fees for filing papers?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Call the Clerk at (415) 551-3900 for information or use the link to <a href=\"/node/34\">Fees</a></p>\n</div>\n<h3>How do I get information about guardianships?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Most guardianships are established through the Probate Department, not through the Unified Family Court.

This process includes ascertaining the individual\u2019s limitations and determining how they could be overcome with a reasonable accommodation, as well as identifying potential accommodations and assessing their effectiveness. Both the individual and the Court are required to participate in this process in good faith.</span><br>\n<br>\n<span lang=\"EN\">The Court will promptly inform the applicant of the determination to grant or deny an accommodation request. If the accommodation request is denied in whole or in part, the response will be in writing and the reason(s) will be provided in writing to the individual requesting the accommodation. Upon the request of the applicant, the Court may also provide an additional response in an alternative format. The response to the applicant will indicate whether the request for accommodation is granted or denied, in whole or in part, or an alternative accommodation is granted.</span></p>\n<p>It shall be the responsibility of each court employee to familiarize themselves with CRC <a href=\"http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=one&amp;linkid=rule1_100\" target=\"_blank\">Rule 1.100</a>, the use of <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/mc410.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Form MC 410</a> and established court procedures for processing request for accommodations.*</p>\n<p><u>Grievances and Appeals</u>:\u00a0If the Court denies your request for accommodation, you have 10 days from the date your request was denied to appeal the Court\u2019s decision.

Dependency mediation services are free and confidential. All parties are ordered, and non-parties may be encouraged, to attend the mediation so that everyone involved in the child's life can participate in making the best plan possible for that child. <a class=\"iconArrowRight\" href=\"http://www.sfcasa.org/\">Court Appointed Special Advocates</a> (CASA) are always invited to a mediation that involves the child with whom they are working. The parties are ordered to attend mediation on a specific day and time.</p>\n<h3>What to Expect During Mediation</h3>\n<p>The mediator meets everyone in the Civic Center Courthouse, Room 402. The mediator explains how mediation works before beginning the session. Sometimes the mediator meets with everyone together. Sometimes the mediator meets with smaller groups of people. Everyone is given the opportunity to talk. The focus of the discussion is what the child needs from everyone involved. How can we make things better for the future?</p>\n<p>Children should not be brought to mediation or to Court unless the Court has specifically ordered them to appear. If children do attend the mediation the mediator will meet first with the child and his or her attorney or other support person. The child may, or may not, participate in the rest of the mediation.</p>\n<h3>What to Expect After Mediation</h3>\n<p>At the end of the mediation session, the mediator will write up the parties' agreement so that it can be presented to the Court.

{"url": "https://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/node/101", "title": "Guidelines of Professional COnduct", "body": "<div id=\"mainContent\" class=\"col-xs-12\">\n<div class=\"contentCenter col-xs-12\">\n<a id=\"main-content\"></a>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-xs-12\">\n<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><h3>PREAMBLE</h3>\n<p>These guidelines are not Rules of Court and do not have the force and effect of Rules of Court. They are standards drafted to formalize the view of the members of the San Francisco Bar Association as to the level of professional conduct expected for the practice of law within the jurisdiction of the courts of the City and County of San Francisco. While litigation is largely an adversarial process and attorneys are ethically bound to zealously represent and advocate their clients' interests, certain guidelines of professional courtesy that should be observed and certain duties of professionalism that are owed by attorneys to their clients, opposing parties, opposing parties' counsel, the courts and the public as a whole.</p>\n<p>These guidelines are not meant as a substitute for other statutes and rules. None of these guidelines is intended to be a method to extend time limitations of statutes and rules including fast track time limitations without an appropriate court order. These guidelines are not meant to be exhaustive, but they are meant to set a tone or guide for conduct not specifically mentioned in these guidelines.</p>\n<p>These have been adopted by the Courts of the City and County of San Francisco as guidelines.</p>\n<h3>SECTION I. <u>NON-DISCRIMINATION</u></h3>\n<p>No attorney shall engage in any bias or discrimination based on age, gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental impairment, religion or race while litigating.</p>\n<h3>SECTION II. <u>SCHEDULING</u></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A.(1) An attorney should communicate with opposing counsel concerning the scheduling of depositions, hearings, meetings and other proceedings and make reasonable efforts to schedule such meetings, hearings, depositions and other proceedings by agreement.<br>\n(2) An attorney shall not arbitrarily or unreasonably withhold consent to a request for scheduling accommodations that do not prejudice his or her client or unduly delay a proceeding.</li>\n<li>B. An attorney should endeavor to reserve sufficient time for the completion of a hearing or deposition to permit a complete presentation or examination by counsel for all parties.</li>\n<li>C. An attorney shall not engage in delay tactics in scheduling meetings, hearings and discovery. An attorney shall not seek extensions or continuances for the purpose of harassment or solely to extend litigation.</li>\n<li>D. An attorney should notify opposing counsel, and, if apropriate, the Court and others affected of scheduling conflicts as soon as they become apparent. An attorney shall notify opposing counsel and, if appropriate, the Court or other tribunal as early as possible of any resolution between the parties that renders a scheduled hearing, deposition or meeting unnecessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SECTION III. SERVICE OF DOCUMENTS</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A. The timing and manner of service of papers should not be calculated to gain an unfair advantage, unduly burden or unnecessarily inconvenience the party receiving the papers. An attorney should not serve papers solely to take advantage of an opponent's known absence from the office or at a time or in a manner designed to inconvenience the adversary, such as late in the day (after normal business hours or on the day preceding a religious holiday), so close to a court appearance that it prohibits the ability of opposing counsel to prepare for that appearance or to respond to the papers (if permitted by law), or in such other way as would unfairly limit the other party's opportunity to respond to those papers or other matters pending in the action.</li>\n<li>B. An attorney should serve papers by personal delivery or by facsimile transmission when it is likely that service by mail, even when allowed, will prejudice the opposing party.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SECTION IV. <u>CONTINUANCES AND EXTENSIONS OF TIME</u></h3>\n<p>Consistent with existing law and court orders, an attorney should grant a reasonable request by opposing counsel for an extension of time within which to respond to a pleading, discovery, and other matters, when such an extension will not prejudice his or her client or unduly delay a proceeding.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A. An attorney shall advise his or her client that the strategy of not agreeing to reasonable requests for time extensions simply to appear \"tough\" is inappropriate.</li>\n<li>B. An attorney should not condition an agreement to an extension on extraneous terms except to preserve rights that an extension might jeopardize or seeking reciprocal scheduling concessions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SECTION V. <u>DISCOVERY</u></h3>\n<p>An attorney should only initiate discovery requests that are reasonably related to the matter at issue. An attorney shall not use discovery (i) for the purpose of harassing, embarrassing or causing the adversary to incur unnecessary expenses, as a means of delaying the timely, efficient and cost-effective resolution of a dispute; or (ii) to obtain an unfair advantage. An attorney shall avoid repetitive or argumentative questions, questions asked solely for the purposes of harassment, or questions which are known to the questioner to be an invasion of the rights of privacy of third parties not present or represented.</p>\n<p>Similarly, an attorney should ensure that responses to reasonable discovery requests are timely, complete and responsive to the discovery request. An attorney responding to written discovery should not do so in an evasive or artificial manner designed to assure that answers and responses are not truly responsive or solely to attempt to avoid a disclosure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A. <u>Depositions</u>. A deposition is to be taken as if the testimony were being given in court. An attorney shall not engage in any conduct during the deposition that would not be allowed in the presence of a judicial official.<br>\n<br>\nAn attorney representing a deponent or representing another party should limit objections to those that are well-founded and necessary for the protection of the client's interests and should not make such objections only for the purpose of argument, harassment, or delay. As most are preserved, objections need be made only when the form of the question is defective or privileged information is sought. An attorney should avoid, through objections or otherwise, improper coaching of a deponent or suggesting answers.</li>\n<li>(1) <u>Written Discovery</u>. Written discovery should not be initiated to harass or embarrass a party or witness or to impose an inordinate burden or expense in responding.<br>\n<br>\nIn responding, an attorney should not interpret the discovery in an artificially restrictive manner in an attempt to avoid disclosure. Similarly, an attorney responding to such discovery should withhold on the ground of privilege only where appropriate and should not respond in a disorganized or unintelligible fashion or in a way calculated to hide or obscure the existence of particular evidence. Similarly, an attorney should not delay responding to prevent opposing counsel from discovery prior to scheduled depositions or for any other tactical reasons.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SECTION VI. <u>MOTIONS</u></h3>\n<p>Motions should be filed sparingly, in good faith and when the issue(s) cannot be otherwise resolved. An attorney should, whenever appropriate, stipulate to all facts and legal authority not reasonably in dispute. An attorney should not engage in conduct which forces opposing counsel to file a motion and then not oppose the motion, or provide information called for in the motion only after the motion is filed.</p>\n<h3>SECTION VII. <u>DEALING WITH OPPOSING COUNSEL</u></h3>\n<p>An attorney should inform his or her client that conflicts with opposing counsel are professional and not personal, that vigorous advocacy is not inconsistent with professional courtesy, and that the conduct of counsel in litigation should not be influenced by ill feelings or anger between clients and their conduct, attitude or demeanor toward opposing attorneys. Further, an attorney should refrain from disparaging or denigrating the Court, opposing counsel, or, except in the course of appropriate examination or argument, parties, or witnesses before clients, the public, or the media.</p>\n<h3>SECTION VIII. <u>DEALING WITH THE COURT</u></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A. In a case where applicable laws or rules permit an ex parte application or communication to the Court, before making such an application or communication, an attorney should make diligent efforts to notify opposing counsel or opposing counsel known to represent or likely to represent the opposing party, should make reasonable efforts to accommodate the schedule of such attorney or party to permit the opposing party to be represented, and should avoid taking advantage of an opponent's known absence from the office.</li>\n<li>B. An attorney should not knowingly misstate, misinterpret or distort any fact or legal authority to the Court or to opposing counsel. Written materials and oral argument to the Court should accurately state current law and fairly represent the party's position without unfairly attacking the opposing counsel or opposing party.</li>\n<li>C. If, after all briefing allowed by law or the Court has been submitted, an attorney locates new authority that he or she desires to bring to the Court's attention at a hearing on the matter, a copy of such new authority shall be provided to both the Court and to all other counsel in the case at or prior to the hearing.</li>\n<li>D. An attorney for the prevailing party should draft a proposed order promptly. The order should fairly and adequately represent the rulings of the Court. When proposed orders are submitted to counsel for approval, an attorney should promptly communicate any objection to the party preparing the proposed order so that good faith discussions can be had concerning the language of the proposed order.</li>\n<li>E. An attorney should respect and abide by the spirit and the letter of all rulings of the Court.</li>\n<li>F. An attorney should be punctual in communications with others, and punctual and prepared for all scheduled appearances.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>", "parent": "https://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/general-info"},

Infractions are enforced by the issuance of citations (\u201ctickets\u201d) by law enforcement. Punishment for infractions requires payment of fines and does not carry any potential jail or prison time. Failure to respond to a citation may lead to additional penalties including imposition of a $300 Civil Assessment and the notification to the Department of Motor Vehicles of your failure to appear, pursuant to Vehicle Code section 40509.5.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">If you Received a Ticket, please read this important <a href=\"/sites/default/files/images/GJ%20Imgs/Information%20Sheet%20doc%20rev%20110518_1.pdf\">Information Sheet</a>.</span></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"/sites/default/files/images/Ability%20to%20Pay%20Webpage%202020-09-15%20FJP.pdf\"><strong>Did you receive a ticket, can't afford to pay?\u00a0Learn more about your options.\u00a0</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong><u>The San Francisco Superior Court does not handle parking tickets, please contact the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.sfmta.com/\">San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency</a>.</u></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Search for Case Calendars by Case Type, plus Date OR Name or Partial Name. \u00a0Information is available up to 120 calendar days from today.</h4>\n<p class=\"button\"><a href=\"http://webapps.sftc.org/cc/CaseCalendar.dll\" target=\"_blank\">Case Calendar</a></p>\n<h3>reminder Notice</h3>\n<p>A Reminder Notice is mailed to the address listed on the citation.

The Probate Judge appoints people and at times institutions and agencies, to act as administrators and executors of wills, as trustees, as guardians of children, and as conservators of adults who cannot handle their own affairs. The Court also supervises these matters and reviews and approves the fees that are charged. In each probate matter, the Judge must apply the law, taking into account the views of all the people involved, the evidence that has been offered and the reports prepared by staff. The Judge must consider what is fair and in the best interests of the people who are involved.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>What staff members help the Judge on my case?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>The Judge is assisted by an administrative staff, examiners and investigators, a lawyer from the Court's attorney staff, courtroom clerks, clerks who receive and process the documents filed by attorneys and the public, and by a bailiff in the courtroom. Examiners review all the petitions in the estates of deceased people, trusts, conservatorships and guardianships. They make certain that the law has been followed and that the accountings are accurate. The investigators go out into the community to see how people are doing, to inform them of their rights, and to report their circumstances, wishes, and concerns to the Judge.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>What type of Probate cases must be e-filed?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>All Probate Estate and Trust cases are subject to e-filing.

The selection of persons for jury service is accomplished by randomly drawing names from the list of registered voters and the Department of Motor Vehicles driver's license and identification card list for San Francisco. The law requires a fair cross-section of each county's qualified residents to be available each day for jury duty. Random summoning enhances juror impartiality. There is no attempt to deliberately inconvenience anyone.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Get exempted from jury service?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>There is no statutory exemption for any occupation except certain categories of peace officers. However, a juror may be disqualified for service for various reasons, such as citizenship, residency, or prior service within the past 12 months. A juror may also ask to be excused for various reasons, such as financial hardship or the need to provide care to another person. The postcard summons has a QR code or URL to submit a request to be excused, postponed, or disqualifed from jury service.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Reschedule my service?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>In order to accommodate your schedule, you may postpone, or reschedule, the start of your jury service once to a more convenient time. The postponement cannot exceed 6 months. You may postpone your service over the phone by calling the Jury Office at (415) 551-3608, entering your badge number (located on the back of the postcard summons), and following the instructions for postponement.\u00a0You may also postpone your service by using the QR code or URL to submit a request for postponement.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Request to be excused or disqualified?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Excuses from service may be granted in specific circumstances. If you want to request to be excused, you may submit a request online by using the QR code or URL on your postcard summons. Requests for excuse or disqualification must be received online\u00a0and cannot be accepted over the phone.\u00a0 To check on the status of your request, you may call the automated system at (415) 551-3608 and enter your badge number.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n<div class=\"accordion-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"controls\"><a class=\"expandall\" href=\"#\">expand all</a> <a class=\"collapseall\" href=\"#\">collapse all</a></div>\n\u00a0\n<div id=\"accordion2\">\n<h3>Is jury service mandatory?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>The U.S. Constitution and the California State Constitution guarantee the right to trial by jury. A\u00a0Postcard Summons is mailed to you to determine if you are qualified to serve jury duty (See Code of Civil Procedure, Section 203(a).)</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Where does the Jury Commissioner obtain names of prospective jurors?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Both the voter registration and motor vehicle records are used as source lists for prospective jurors. Names are randomly selected from the countywide population by computer. If your name and address do not match exactly in both the voter registration and motor vehicle records, you may have more than one record in the jury system. If this happens, you may receive more than one summons in a 1-year period. If you receive more than one summons in a 1-year period, please contact the Jury Office at 415-551-3608.</p>\n<p>The Court receives its data from these two sources each year in October. If you have moved out of the City recently, the Court may have still received your name from either the DMV or the Department of Elections. You must notify DMV within 10 days of your move. Registering to vote in another county does not necessarily remove your name from the SF Department of Elections rolls; you should also call the Department of Elections to tell them that you no longer live in the City.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>How many days will I have to serve?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>You may be required to appear anytime during the 5-day period of your jury service. You are required to obtain reporting instructions, by calling the Court at (415) 551-3608 or visiting the website, every day for the duration of the one week of jury service. You are required to follow your reporting instructions for every day of your service week.</p>\n<p>If you are not required to report during the 5-day period, your jury service is completed for one year.</p>\n<p>If you are asked to report and come in to the courthouse, but are not assigned to a courtroom for jury selection on the day you report, your jury service is completed for one year.</p>\n<p>If you are assigned to a courtroom for jury selection that is not completed by the end of that day, you are required to return to finish the selection for that trial.</p>\n<p>If you are selected to serve on a trial, your term of service will be the length of that trial.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>May I postpone my jury service to a more convenient time?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Yes. The Court realizes prospective jurors may be summoned at an inconvenient time and is willing to postpone service to a more convenient time. You may postpone your jury service by calling the automated system at (415) 551-3608 or by using the QR code or URL to submit a request for postponement. Jurors are entitled to a one-time postponement not to exceed 6 months from the summons date.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"floatRight\" class=\"col-xs-4 hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md\">\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"imgborder\" src=\"/sites/default/files/images/i_jurypage.jpg\" style=\"height:136px; width:205px\"></p>\n<h3>Contact Information &amp; Directions</h3>\n<p><strong>Juror Information Line</strong></p>\n<p>(415) 551-3608</p>\n<p>8:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>Monday through Friday, except Court holidays</p>\n<p><a href=\"/node/92\">Civic Center Jury Assembly Room</a><br>\nCivic Center Courthouse<br>\n400 McAllister St., Room 007<br>\nSan Francisco, CA 94102</p>\n<p><strong>Jury Assembly Room Hours:</strong></p>\n<p>8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>Monday through Friday, except Court holidays<br>\n<a href=\"/node/92\">Directions</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/node/93\">Hall of Justice Jury Assembly Room</a><br>\n850 Bryant St., Room 307<br>\nSan Francisco, CA 94103</p>\n<p><strong>Jury Assembly Room Hours:</strong></p>\n<p>8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>Monday through Friday, except Court holidays<br>\n<a href=\"/node/93\">Directions</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>", "parent": "https://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/divisions"},

In Juvenile Dependency Court cases, the child may have been removed from the home by a Child Protective Services social worker because there is information that the child is being neglected, abused, or is in danger. The child then lives in a licensed home while several court actions take place. One such action is to try and reunify the child with his or her parents. If reunification is not successful, a guardian may be appointed for the child. Relatives or friends may be appointed to serve. If appropriate, the guardianship can continue until the child turns 18. </span></span></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">In Probate Court guardianships, the child usually lives with the person who is the guardian. The proposed guardian or another person in the child\u2019s life may petition the Court to establish the guardianship for a variety of reasons. The parents of the child may be unable to care for the child due to serious illness, military duty in another country, drug or alcohol addiction, incarceration, or death. Unlike Juvenile Dependency Court, the Probate Court suspends, rather than terminates parental rights. A parent, a guardian, or another person can file a petition for termination of a probate guardianship, as can a child who is 12 years-old or older. </span></span></span></p>\n<ul class=\"square\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.courts.ca.gov/1214.htm\">Guardianship of Children - Self-Help</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#2\">Probate Guardianship Process</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#3\">Guardianship Appointment Hearings</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#4\">After a Guardian has been Appointed</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Forms</h3>\n<ul class=\"square\">\n<li class=\"iconArrowRight\"><a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm/?filter=GC\">California Courts Forms/Guardianship</a></li>\n<li class=\"iconPDFRight\"><a href=\"/sites/default/files/pdfs/gc251.pdf\">GC-251 - Confidential Guardianship Status Report</a></li>\n<li class=\"iconPDFRight\"><a href=\"/sites/default/files/images/PRB-PGN-001%20Confidential%20Declaration%20of%20Proposed%20Guardian.pdf\">Declaration of Proposed Guardian</a></li>\n<li class=\"iconPDFRight\"><a href=\"/sites/default/files/images/PRB-PGN-002%20Confidential%20Request%20to%20End%20Guardianship.pdf\">Request to End Guardianship</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Guardianship of Children - Self-Help</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">If you want to ask the Court to establish the guardianship over the person of a child, you may wish to make an appointment with the <u>ACCESS Center</u> and ask for help.</span></span></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">If you already filed for guardianship of the person and need assistance with next steps, the ACCESS Center may be able to help you figure out which relatives to serve (give notice), and the paperwork you are required to send.</span></span></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">If you want to ask the Court to end a guardianship, the ACCESS Center may be able to show you how to fill out the required forms that must be filed.</span></span></span></p>\n<h2>Probate Guardianship Process</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\">When a petition for probate guardianship of the person, estate, or person and estate is filed, a court investigator personally interviews the child and other significant people in the child\u2019s life. Background screenings are conducted<s> </s>on the proposed guardian and all other adults who live with the child. Once the investigation is completed, the investigator will file a confidential report for the Judge. Sometimes, a Judge will also appoint an attorney to represent the child. </span></span></span></p>\n<h2>Guardianship Appointment Hearings</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style='font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif'><span style=\"color:#333333\">When a petition for guardianship is filed, the Court Clerk will provide a court date for the hearing. Guardianship appointment hearings are held on Tuesday afternoons. All petitions for the establishment of a guardianship of the person require the proposed guardian and the proposed ward to attend the court hearing. If the petition seeks to appoint a guardian over the child\u2019s estate only, the proposed guardian must attend and the child\u2019s appearance at the appointment hearing is not required</span></span></span></span></p>\n<h2>After a Guardian has been Appointed</h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0in; text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">Even after a guardian has been appointed, the Probate Court continues to be concerned about the child. Every year, the Probate Court sends a blank Status Report form to the guardian along with a return envelope. Therefore, it is important for guardians to make sure the court has their current contact information. All guardians are required to fill out the annual Status Report with information about how the child is doing. When there is a guardianship of the estate, the guardian is required to account for the child\u2019s assets and is not allowed to spend any of the money in the estate without permission from the Judge.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0in; text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"background:white\"><span style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#333333\">All children need care and attention. Fortunately, there are people in our community who are willing to step forward and serve as guardians when a child\u2019s parents are not available. The Probate Court participates in this process by appointing guardians for children, by helping make certain that children in guardianships are protected, and by helping guardians get the information they need.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"floatRight\" class=\"col-xs-4 hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md\">\n<h3>Contact us, Hours &amp; Directions</h3>\n<p style=\"padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-right: 0px\">Judge Joseph M.

You can ask the court to make orders on the following once you file your case:<br>\n\u2022 Custody and Visitation<br>\n\u2022 Child Support<br>\n\u2022 Spousal/Partner Support<br>\n\u2022 Property Division<br>\n\u2022 Domestic Violence Restraining Order<br>\n\u2022 Attorney's Fees\u00a0</p>\n<p>A <strong>legal separation </strong>does not end your marriage and/or domestic partnership. You cannot remarry or enter into a domestic partnership with someone else at the end of a legal separation. However, you can still ask the court to make the same orders as in a divorce. You do not need to meet California's residency requirement to file for a legal separation.

In California, this legal arrangement is called a conservatorship.</p>\n<p>Conservatorships are established for impaired adults, most often older people. Adults who are developmentally disabled or the victims of a catastrophic illness or accident also may have a conservatorship.</p>\n<p>For help filling out the <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm/%20Instructions?filter=GC\">forms </a>to file a conservatorship, please visit <a href=\"https://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/self-help\">ACCESS</a>.</p>\n<ul class=\"square\">\n<li><a href=\"#1\">When Conservatorship is Necessary</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#2\">Conservatorship Process</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#3\">After a Conservatorship is Established</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#4\">Non-Family Conservators</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.aging.ca.gov\">Those Most in Need of Conservatorship</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>When Conservatorship is Necessary</h4>\n<p>Establishing a conservatorship is a formal legal proceeding and involves several steps. Some adults who are concerned about possible future mental and physical incapacity decide to establish a power of attorney or a trust, in part so they can avoid the court action. They choose an individual or an institution to make decisions for them if they become impaired. These are private arrangements and must be made while the person has full mental capacity. In California, courts do not routinely monitor powers of attorney or trusts. Most people do not make these arrangements probably because it is difficult to think about becoming incapacitated mentally or physically. But it happens, especially to people over 75 years of age. For those who have not made prior arrangements, or if the person handling the power of attorney or trust is incapable or dishonest, a conservatorship may become necessary.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>After a Conservatorship is Established</h2>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h4>Management of Wealth and Property</h4>\n<p>When a conservatorship is established, the Judge will require that a bond be obtained for the liquid assets and annual income in the person's estate. Liquid assets include bank accounts and stocks. A bond is like an insurance policy. If the conservator mishandles the money or takes it, the person in conservatorship can be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>The Judge also schedules the case for Court monitoring of the finances and property of the person in conservatorship as well as his or her welfare. The law requires that an Inventory and Appraisal of all assets be filed within 90 days of the appointment of the conservator. The conservator must also file a General Plan for the conservatorship. If the conservatee has any real property, the conservator must record evidence of the conservatorship with The Recorder of the City and County of San Francisco.</p>\n<h4>One Year Review</h4>\n<p>One year after the appointment of the conservator and every two years thereafter, an accounting of the assets, including the income and the expenditures must be filed with the Court. The accounting is reviewed in detail by a probate examiner. An investigator personally interviews the individual in conservatorship periodically and determines if the conservator is acting properly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Non-Family Conservators</h2>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are times when family members are unavailable or incapable of serving as conservators. Occasionally, the person who is thought to need a conservator does not want a family member to be the conservator. In those situations, there are agencies and individuals that can serve. The Public Guardian is an agency of the City and County of San Francisco and is the largest non-family conservator. There are also non-profit agencies that have complied with the law and can be appointed to serve as conservators. In addition there are individuals who are available to serve. They are called private professional conservators. As of July 1, 2008, they must be licensed by the State of California and meet ongoing educational requirements. All professional conservators are expected to keep a case and provide services even if the money runs out, especially if they have been appointed to serve as conservator of the person.</p>\n<p>All conservators and attorneys in a conservatorship case are entitled to request the Court for fees for their work. The fees are carefully reviewed and granted by the Probate Court only if they have been properly justified. Conservators and attorneys cannot take money without a formal court order.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Those Most in Need of a Conservatorship</h2>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Conservatorships affect mainly older people, especially those over 85 years of age. Coincidentally, the fastest growing age group in the United States is the one over 85 years of age. In California, that age group will increase by 143 percent between 1990 and 2020. Some counties will experience even higher rates, up to 400 percent. The influence of the 85 and older age group will emerge most strongly between 2030 and 2040 as the first of the baby boomers reaches 85 years of age (<a href=\"http://www.aging.ca.gov\">http://www.aging.ca.gov</a>). With the right genes, healthy living, and luck, most people will escape being incapacitated. However, many San Franciscans will have impairments and will need help with daily living. Most likely the number of conservatorships will increase over time. Fortunately, the California legislature has mandated many court safeguards for those who need conservatorships.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"floatRight\" class=\"col-xs-4 hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md\">\n<h3>Contact Us, Hours &amp; Directions</h3>\n<p>Judge Joseph M.

The clinical team uses Forensic Assertive Community Treatment, Illness Management and Recovery, Trauma Informed Care, Integrated Dual Diagnosis Treatment, and Dialectical Behavior Therapy. In 2008, BHC received the Council on Mentally Ill Offenders (COMIO) Best Practices Award.</p>\n<h4>Supported Employment</h4>\n<p>In 2008, the Court added Supported Employment to\u00a0its list of evidence-based practices. Behavioral Health Court\u2019s Supported Employment Program provides support to clients with major mental illness by helping them to find and maintain employment and eliminate barriers that forensic mental health consumers face. The goal is to provide competitive work in integrated work settings that match the capabilities and interests of clients for whom competitive employment has not traditionally occurred.</p>\n<h4>Continuum of Care</h4>\n<p>BHC provides a seamless continuum of care beginning with in-jail services, transitional care prior to release, and early release into the community. Jail Psychiatric Services (JPS) supports psychiatric treatment for inmates and is the first link to the continuum of care model. Jail Aftercare Services (JAS) is responsible for screening inmates for BHC eligibility, presenting the case to the BHC legal team, and providing transitional and linkage case management services as clients leave the jail and connect with community treatment providers. The continuum of care concept is one of the most innovative in the country and is responsible for enhancing a client's successful return to the community.</p>\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n<h4>What is the history of BHC?</h4>\n<p>The Behavioral Health Court was created in 2002 in response to the increasing numbers of mentally ill defendants cycling through the jails and courts. It is a collaboration among the Superior Court, Public Defender's Office, District Attorney's Office, Sheriff's Department, Haight Ashbury Free Clinic's Jail Psychiatric Services (JPS), UCSF's Citywide Case Management, and the Department of Public Health.</p>\n<h4>What are the goals of BHC?</h4>\n<p>BHC strives to achieve the following goals: 1) connect criminal defendants who suffer from serious mental illness to treatment services in the community; 2) find appropriate dispositions to the criminal charges that consider the mental illness and the seriousness of the offense; and 3) ensure public safety by decreasing recidivism through appropriate mental health treatment and intensive supervision.</p>\n<h4>How does BHC work and what is the criteria for participation?</h4>\n<p>Participation in BHC is voluntary, and in many instances, the defendant does not have to enter a guilty plea to criminal charges in order to enter. The Judge and lawyers work closely with the mental health providers who provide intensive case management to the clients with a focus on the person's diagnosis and psychosocial needs rather than criminal charges. Eligibility for BHC is based on: 1) diagnosis (must have an Axis I mental health disorder); 2) gravity of the criminal charges; and 3) suitability and amenability to treatment in the community mental health system.\u00a0 As a general rule, if the defendant's mental illness is a primary motivating factor in the criminal activity that brought the defendant into the criminal justice system, the case will be considered for BHC. In the interest of public safety, defendants who commit certain violent charges are not allowed in the program. On average 140 clients are being monitored in BHC.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"floatRight\" class=\"col-xs-4 hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md\">\n<p style=\"padding-bottom: 0px\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"imgborder\" src=\"/sites/default/files/images/Crompton-Charles-6135.jpg\" style=\"width: 135px; height: 200px;\"></p>\n<p style=\"padding-bottom: 0px\">Judge Charles Crompton</p>\n<h3>Contact INformation</h3>\n<p><strong>Judge Charles Crompton</strong><br>\n<span style=\"display: none\">\u00a0</span>Hall of Justice<br>\n850 Bryant St.<br>\nSan Francisco, CA 94103<br>\nDepartment 15<br>\n(415) 551-0315</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://207.215.212.59/general-info/directions/hall-of-justice\">Directions</a></p>\n<h3>BHC News &amp; Articles</h3>\n<ul class=\"square\">\n<li><em>San Francisco Examiner</em>, December 2015<br>\n<a class=\"iconArrowRight\" href=\"http://www.sfexaminer.com/a-court-for-the-10th-circle-of-hell/\">A Court for the 10th Circle</a></li>\n<li><i>SAMHSA Gains Center Monthly Newsletter, June 2014</i><br>\n<a class=\"iconArrowRight\" href=\"http://gainscenter.samhsa.gov/eNews/june14.html\">Spotlight on the San Francisco Behavioral Health Court</a></li>\n<li><em>San Francisco Examiner</em>, January 2011<br>\n<a class=\"iconArrowRight\" href=\"http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/credo/2011/01/judge-mary-morgan-reaching-out-mentally-ill\" span=\"\">Judge Mary Morgan on reaching out to the mentally ill</a></li>\n<li><em>Los Angeles Times</em>, October 2010<br>\n<a class=\"iconArrowRight\" href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-mental-court-20101025,0,3297466.story\" span=\"\">Mentally Ill Prisoners Get a Second Chance</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"iconArrowRight\" href=\"http://www.californiareport.org/archive/R907090850/a\" span=\"\">When Mentally Ill People Encounter the Criminal Justice System</a>, July 2009<br>\n<u>The California Report </u>(KQED)</li>\n<li>People with Disabilities Foundation Newsletter, January 2009<br>\n<u><a class=\"iconArrowRight\" href=\"http://www.pwdf.org/enews/Winter08_Vol_6_Community_Currents.html#3#3\" span=\"\">Breaking the Cycle of Recidivism: Alternative Sentencing for Criminal Defendants with Psychiatric Illness</a></u></li>\n<li><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, November 2007<br>\n<a class=\"iconPDFRight\" href=\"/sites/default/files/pdfs/2208%20Special%20Court%20in%20SF%20offers%20hope%20and%20Help.pdf\">Special Court in S.F. offers hope and help to those short on both</a></li>\n<li><em>SF Weekly</em>, August 2007<br>\n<a class=\"iconArrowRight\" href=\"http://www.sfweekly.com/2007-08-08/news/breaking-the-cycle/\" span=\"\">Breaking the Cycle: From Hard-Core Homeless to Jail and Back Again.

Using a team approach, SFDC is an intensive rehabilitation program that integrates substance abuse disorder treatment and social services with judicial oversight to monitor client accountability and facilitate recovery. The Drug Court Team includes representatives from the San Francisco Superior Court, the Department of Public Health, the District Attorney's Office, the Public Defender's Office, and the Adult Probation Department and community based treatment providers.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>San Francisco's Adult Drug Court Goals:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"square\">\n<li>Thorough screening and assessment to ensure that each participant receives appropriate substance abuse disorder treatment services and community-based support.</li>\n<li>Consistent judicial monitoring that supports the client\u2019s progress and emphasizes accountability and commitment to the program.</li>\n<li>Partnerships with other community agencies that address multiple issues faced by participants including substance abuse disorders, mental health, homelessness, employment, and medical problems.</li>\n<li>Increase public safety by reducing recidivism among substance-abusing individuals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>program components</h3>\n<p>SFDC has its own treatment clinic called the Community Justice Service Center (CJSC) which is co-located with the Community Justice Center at 555 Polk St. After enrollment, a participant\u2019s treatment is monitored by the Court. A series of sanctions and incentives are used to encourage compliance with treatment. Those who are non-compliant receive graduated sanctions such as writing an essay, community service or jail time - to encourage behavioral change and adherence with treatment. Throughout their participation in Drug Court, clients attend regular judicial status hearings and undergo intensive case management, randomized urinalysis testing, counseling, and ancillary services including mental health treatment, vocational/education services, anger management counseling, and supportive housing. Upon successful program completion, generally after 10 to 24 months, probation is terminated or charges are dismissed.</p>\n<h3>Mission</h3>\n<p>The San Francisco Drug Treatment Program seeks to connect criminal defendants who suffer from a substantial substance abuse treatment disorders \u00a0to \u00a0services in the community in order to enhance public safety, reduce recidivism, and to find appropriate dispositions to the criminal charges that take into consideration the individual\u2019s substance abuse disorders, mental and physical health, and the seriousness of the offense.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"floatRight\" class=\"col-xs-4 hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md\">\n<h3>Contact\u00a0information &amp; Directions</h3>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/images/Begert-Michael-6974.jpg\" style=\"width: 135px; height: 203px;\"></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Judge Michael I.
