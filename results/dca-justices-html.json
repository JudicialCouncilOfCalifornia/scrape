(Ed) Wallin had a \u201cwonderful upbringing\u201d in a small house in Minneapolis, where he lived in a small corner in the basement. He was the first member of his extended family to go to college, commuting to the University of Minnesota during his undergraduate years (B.A. 1974) and law school (J.D., cum laude, 1967). At the time Wallin decided to go to law school, he did not even know a lawyer.</p>\n\n<p>Wallin accepted a legal position in the Orange County office of Kindel &amp; Anderson, when he came out to interview during a very \u201ccold winter.\u201d He ended up working during his first three years at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Los Angeles, where he gained trial experience prosecuting mail fraud and obscenity cases. Wallin returned to Kindel &amp; Anderson in 1970 as a \u201cvery experienced\u201d trial lawyer and remained at the firm until 1978.</p>\n\n<p>Judge Bruce Sumner suggested that Governor Jerry Brown appoint Wallin to the superior court because of his business background and strong interest in public service. (Wallin was inspired by the example set by Minnesota\u2019s Hubert Humphrey.)</p>\n\n<p>In 1978, Wallin became the youngest superior court judge in the state. He served on the Orange County Superior Court for over four years, three years of which he served as a law-and-motion judge. He handled a spate of newsworthy cases, including <em>Davidson v. City of Westminster</em> (1982) 32 Cal.3d 197, where Wallin ruled (and the California Supreme Court unanimously affirmed) that police officers who were conducting a stakeout of a laundromat did not owe a duty of care to warn a patron when the suspected attacker entered the premises. \u201cI ruled that the police did not have a duty to warn the woman,\u201d Wallin said, \u201cbecause it would be unfair to say our officers have to anticipate a crime so suddenly that they could rescue the citizen.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In a nationally significant case, Wallin ruled that federal law preempts state law restrictions on due-on-sale clauses in mortgage contracts for federally regulated lenders. The Supreme Court of the United States later upheld Wallin\u2019s decision. (<em>Fidelity Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. de la Cuesta </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 141.) According to Wallin, \u201cit\u2019s nice to know I got one right.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In 1982, Brown elevated Wallin to Orange County\u2019s newly formed appellate court, where he served as an associate justice for over 16 years. Wallin described the court\u2019s early days: \u201cEverybody just worked like crazy, because nobody knew what we were doing; we were all new.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Wallin is responsible for a significant First Amendment opinion exonerating publishers from a broad duty to investigate the safety of advertised products. \u201cSuch a tort would require publications to maintain huge staffs scrutinizing and testing each product offered.

(Ed) Wallin had a \u201cwonderful upbringing\u201d in a small house in Minneapolis, where he lived in a small corner in the basement. He was the first member of his extended family to go to college, commuting to the University of Minnesota during his undergraduate years (B.A. 1974) and law school (J.D., cum laude, 1967). At the time Wallin decided to go to law school, he did not even know a lawyer.\n\nWallin accepted a legal position in the Orange County office of Kindel &amp; Anderson, when he came out to interview during a very \u201ccold winter.\u201d He ended up working during his first three years at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Los Angeles, where he gained trial experience prosecuting mail fraud and obscenity cases. Wallin returned to Kindel &amp; Anderson in 1970 as a \u201cvery experienced\u201d trial lawyer and remained at the firm until 1978.\n\nJudge Bruce Sumner suggested that Governor Jerry Brown appoint Wallin to the superior court because of his business background and strong interest in public service. (Wallin was inspired by the example set by Minnesota\u2019s Hubert Humphrey.)\n\nIn 1978, Wallin became the youngest superior court judge in the state. He served on the Orange County Superior Court for over four years, three years of which he served as a law-and-motion judge. He handled a spate of newsworthy cases, including Davidson v. City of Westminster (1982) 32 Cal.3d 197, where Wallin ruled (and the California Supreme Court unanimously affirmed) that police officers who were conducting a stakeout of a laundromat did not owe a duty of care to warn a patron when the suspected attacker entered the premises. \u201cI ruled that the police did not have a duty to warn the woman,\u201d Wallin said, \u201cbecause it would be unfair to say our officers have to anticipate a crime so suddenly that they could rescue the citizen.\u201d\n\nIn a nationally significant case, Wallin ruled that federal law preempts state law restrictions on due-on-sale clauses in mortgage contracts for federally regulated lenders. The Supreme Court of the United States later upheld Wallin\u2019s decision. (Fidelity Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. de la Cuesta (1982) 458 U.S. 141.) According to Wallin, \u201cit\u2019s nice to know I got one right.\u201d\n\nIn 1982, Brown elevated Wallin to Orange County\u2019s newly formed appellate court, where he served as an associate justice for over 16 years. Wallin described the court\u2019s early days: \u201cEverybody just worked like crazy, because nobody knew what we were doing; we were all new.\u201d\n\nWallin is responsible for a significant First Amendment opinion exonerating publishers from a broad duty to investigate the safety of advertised products. \u201cSuch a tort would require publications to maintain huge staffs scrutinizing and testing each product offered. The enormous cost of such groups, along with skyrocketing insurance rates, would deter many magazines from accepting advertising, hastening their demise from lack of revenue.\u201d (Walters v. Seventeen Magazine (1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 1119 [magazine reader developed toxic shock after using advertised tampon product].)\n\nWallin authored the court\u2019s opinion in Golden West Baseball Club v. City of Anaheim (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 11, at the time the most expensive civil litigation case in Orange County\u2019s history, regarding disputed ownership over the parking lot for Anaheim Stadium, and conflicting promises to the Angels baseball club and the Los Angeles Rams football franchise.\n\nIn another baseball case, Wallin affirmed a summary judgment for a Little League organization in a lawsuit brought by the parents of an 11-year old boy who was hit by an errant pitch while batting during a game.

His colleague, Justice Bill Bedsworth remarked on his legacy, \u201cRooms got warmer and brighter when Dave Sills walked into them. People got better. Problems seemed smaller. As long as Dave Sills was in charge, you knew the helm was tended, the ship was on course.\u201d\nAt a memorial service, California Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye paid tribute not only to Sills but also to the \u201ccourage and compassion\u201d of his wife, Susan. \u201cBecause all of us know that a hero in public life, a hero on the courts, and a hero in our U.S. armed services, always has another hero; and we know that, throughout it, it was you, Susan.\u201d"},

He said he chose over Harvard Law School, where he also was accepted, because it was the \u201cbest in the country.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Following his graduation, Scoville worked for a well-established civil litigation firm in Los Angeles. Eventually, he accepted a position at a law firm in Orange County.</p>\n\n<p>In 1967, Governor Ronald Reagan named Scoville for a position on the municipal court. A year later, he was elevated to the Orange County Superior Court, where he rose to supervise probate and law-and-motion departments, eventually becoming the court\u2019s presiding judge for two consecutive terms.</p>\n\n<p>Among Scoville\u2019s leading trial court cases was <em>Phipps v. Saddleback Valley Unified School Dist., </em>where he ordered an 11-year old boy with AIDS antibodies returned to class. His order was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, in an opinion authored by Justice Sheila Sonenshine. (See 204\u00a0Cal.App.3d 1110.)</p>\n\n<p>In 1988, Governor George Deukmejian nominated Scoville, who had gained a reputation as a \u201cjudge\u2019s judge,\u201d to replace Presiding Justice John K. (Jack) Trotter.</p>\n\n<p>As an appellate justice, Scoville authored one of the leading premises liability opinions on duty of care. In <em>Knighten v. Sam\u2019s Parking Valet </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 69, the court held that neither a restaurant nor a valet service had a duty to withhold keys from an intoxicated patron of the restaurant. \u201cThe right to act,\u201d Scoville wrote, \u201cis far different from a duty to act. The two should not be confused.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In like fashion, in a widely-quoted opinion, Scoville analyzed the state\u2019s potential liability for harm caused by a parolee. (<em>Brenneman v. State of California </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 812.)</p>\n\n<p>In <em>Chaparro v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 560, Scoville, writing for the court, held that inmates of a state youth authority were entitled to notice and hearing before being transferred to the general court system for resentencing to summarily commit them to prison.</p>\n\n<p>In January 1989, Scoville shepherded the appellate court\u2019s move from rented office space to a two-story gabled structure on Spurgeon Street, doubling the court\u2019s space, and allowing it to remain at the same location for decades.</p>\n\n<p>Scoville resigned as presiding justice, effective April 1990, to accept a position as special master of the Buck Trust, which had assets of more than $250 million. In his honor, the Orange County Bar Association established the Harmon G. Scoville Award, for a member of the Orange County legal community \u201cwhose career exemplifies the highest standards of the legal profession .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d Scoville was the first awardee in 1990.</p>\n\n<p>Scoville greatly enjoyed being a settlement judge. At the superior court, Scoville took pride in settling more than half the cases that were sent to him. Following his elevation, Scoville established Division Three\u2019s judicial settlement program. Even after his retirement, Scoville returned to the court to serve as its judicial settlement officer for more than five years. He was known for charming litigants into settling by his courtly manners, and by plying them with donuts.</p>\n\n<p>On his death, Scoville was survived by his wife, 6 children, 40 grandchildren, and 18\u00a0great-grandchildren.</p>\n\n<p></p>    \n    \n    </div>\n</div>\n<!-- End Plain Text Module -->\n                                    </div>\n                                    \n                                    \n                                                                           \n                                </div>"], "bodytext": "December 21, 1922 - September 19, 2008\nJudge, Orange County Municipal Court, 1967-1969\nJudge, Orange County Superior Court, 1969-1987\nPresiding Justice, Court of Appeal, 4th District, Division 3, 1988-1990\n\nHarmon G.

Saddleback Valley Unified School Dist., where he ordered an 11-year old boy with AIDS antibodies returned to class. His order was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, in an opinion authored by Justice Sheila Sonenshine. (See 204\u00a0Cal.App.3d 1110.)\n\nIn 1988, Governor George Deukmejian nominated Scoville, who had gained a reputation as a \u201cjudge\u2019s judge,\u201d to replace Presiding Justice John K. (Jack) Trotter.\n\nAs an appellate justice, Scoville authored one of the leading premises liability opinions on duty of care. In Knighten v. Sam\u2019s Parking Valet (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 69, the court held that neither a restaurant nor a valet service had a duty to withhold keys from an intoxicated patron of the restaurant. \u201cThe right to act,\u201d Scoville wrote, \u201cis far different from a duty to act. The two should not be confused.\u201d\n\nIn like fashion, in a widely-quoted opinion, Scoville analyzed the state\u2019s potential liability for harm caused by a parolee. (Brenneman v. State of California (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 812.)\n\nIn Chaparro v. Superior Court (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 560, Scoville, writing for the court, held that inmates of a state youth authority were entitled to notice and hearing before being transferred to the general court system for resentencing to summarily commit them to prison.\n\nIn January 1989, Scoville shepherded the appellate court\u2019s move from rented office space to a two-story gabled structure on Spurgeon Street, doubling the court\u2019s space, and allowing it to remain at the same location for decades.\n\nScoville resigned as presiding justice, effective April 1990, to accept a position as special master of the Buck Trust, which had assets of more than $250 million. In his honor, the Orange County Bar Association established the Harmon G. Scoville Award, for a member of the Orange County legal community \u201cwhose career exemplifies the highest standards of the legal profession .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d Scoville was the first awardee in 1990.\n\nScoville greatly enjoyed being a settlement judge. At the superior court, Scoville took pride in settling more than half the cases that were sent to him. Following his elevation, Scoville established Division Three\u2019s judicial settlement program. Even after his retirement, Scoville returned to the court to serve as its judicial settlement officer for more than five years. He was known for charming litigants into settling by his courtly manners, and by plying them with donuts.\n\nOn his death, Scoville was survived by his wife, 6 children, 40 grandchildren, and 18\u00a0great-grandchildren."},

After his military service, he resumed his education, graduating from Ohio State University in 1955 and from its School of Law three years later. He was admitted to the California Bar on January 7, 1959. He moved to Imperial County, where he served as a deputy district attorney from January 1959 to July 1960. He then entered private practice where he remained until his appointment to the Imperial County Superior Court on January 12, 1976, by Governor Edmund G.

After serving approximately 4 1/2 years on the Superior Court, Governor Brown elevated him to a newly created position on Division One of the Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District on July 1, 1980. Following an August 11 hearing confirming the appointment, the oath of office was administered on August 22, 1980.

Returning to Colorado, he graduated in 1939 from the University of Colorado in Boulder with a bachelor of arts and a bachelor of education degrees. He worked his way through school as a store clerk, laborer and a sergeant in the National Guard Armory at Boulder. Following graduation, he was an elementary school principal in Holyoke, Colorado and then a high school history and government teacher in Wickenburg, Arizona. In 1941 and 1942, he did post-graduate work in political science and public administration at the University of California, Berkeley, and at the University of Colorado. During the three years that followed, he worked as a tool designer and draftsman at Douglas Aircraft Company while he attended the University of Southern California Law School from which he graduated first in his class. He was admitted to the Bar on December 11, 1945. He served as law clerk to U.S. Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, Judge William Healy from 1945 to 1946 and to former California Supreme Court Chief Justice Phil S. Gibson in 1946. He then moved to San Diego where he practiced law from 1947 to 1959, as well as taught government and criminology at San Diego Junior College and advanced business law at San Diego State College (now University). Governor Edmund G. Brown, Sr. appointed him to the San Diego County Municipal Court on November 10, 1959, and later elevated him to the San Diego County Superior Court on March 2, 1964. He was an Adjunct Professor of Law at the University of San Diego School of Law from 1964 to 1968, inclusive. He was also on the faculty at the California College of Trial Judges (now California Judicial College (CJER)) from 1970 to 1971. On December 22, 1976 (date of oath), he succeeded Associate Justice Vincent A. Whelan on Division One of the Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District, upon his appointment by Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr. on November 17. He served on the Commission on Judicial Performance from 1979 to 1986.

Later, he accepted the appointment on May 8, 1930, to serve through the remainder of that year and took the oath five days later. He then returned to trial work until 1939 when pneumonia forced him to discontinue it. Extremely active in the community, Presiding Justice Cary served as president of the San Diego County Bar Association and chairman of the San Diego Red Cross. He died of a heart attack at his Point Loma home on September 22, 1943."},

In 1876, Chipman moved to Red Bluff, California, where he practiced law, farmed, and for 15 years served on the State Board of Trade. In 1897, he was appointed Commissioner of the Supreme Court, a position he held until the commission was disbanded and replaced by the District Courts of Appeal.
