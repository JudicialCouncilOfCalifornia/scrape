This commitment extends to court staff, job seekers, legal professionals, litigants, defendants and witnesses. Individuals with disabilities are encouraged to seek accommodations from the court.</p>\n\n<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and state law require all state and local governmental entities, including the courts, to provide reasonable accommodations for the needs of persons with disabilities. Under the ADA and state law, a person is entitled to an accommodation if he or she has a physical or mental medical condition that limits one or more major life activity, has a record of such condition, or is regarded as having such condition.</p>\n\n<p>It is the policy of the Marin County Superior Court to ensure that qualified persons with disabilities have equal and full access to the judicial system. Court staff shall make every effort to assist individuals requesting reasonable accommodations in accordance with California Rule of Court,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=one&amp;linkid=rule1_100\" target=\"_blank\"><b><u>Rule 1.100</u></b></a>. For answers to common questions about disability accommodations, please read the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/Disability-Accommodations-in-California-Courts.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><b><u>Disability Accommodations in California Courts (PDF)</u></b></a>\u00a0Pamphlet.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Request an Accommodation</h2>\n\n<p>Applications requesting accommodations for a disability may be presented in writing on a Disability Accommodation Request <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/mc410.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>(Form MC-410)</b></a> and submitted in person, by mail, or orally. Applications may be made to the ADA Coordinator, Clerk\u2019s Office, Court Administration or the Courtroom at the following address:</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-align-left\">3501 Civic Center Drive, Room 116<br>\nSan Rafael, CA 94903</p>\n\n<p>All applications for accommodations must include a description of the accommodation sought, along with a statement of the medical condition and an explanation why such accommodation is necessary. The Court, at its discretion, may require the applicant to provide additional information about the qualifying disability.<br>\nWhen making a telephone request, please have the following information readily available:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Name and address of person requiring the accommodation</li>\n\t<li>Case name, if available</li>\n\t<li>Jury duty or type of proceeding (civil, criminal, juvenile, family law and probate)</li>\n\t<li>Date the accommodation is needed</li>\n\t<li>Reason why accommodation is necessary</li>\n\t<li>Type of accommodation</li>\n</ul><p><b>For assistance please contact the Court\u2019s ADA Coordinator by phone (415) 444-7020 or email <a href=\"mailto:%20HR@marin.courts.ca.gov\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">HR@marin.courts.ca.gov</a>.</b></p>\n\n<p>Requests for accommodations should be made as far in advance as possible, and in any event should be made no less than five (5) court days prior to the date needed. The Court may, at its discretion, waive this requirement.</p>\n\n<h2>Accommodations</h2>\n\n<p>The Court, when possible, will provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services for persons with disabilities to ensure that individuals with disabilities will be able to participate in the complete range of court services, programs and activities. The Court will make reasonable efforts to accommodate disability accommodation requests made less than five (5) court days before a hearing or other court appearance.</p>\n\n<ul><li><b>PERSONS WHO ARE DEAF OR HARD OF HEARING</b><br>\n\tThe Court may provide assistive listening devices, Communication Access Real-Time Translation (CART), qualified sign language interpreters or written materials.</li>\n\t<li><b>PERSONS WHO ARE BLIND OR HAVE VISION LOSS</b><br>\n\tThe Court may provide large print, Braille materials or electronic format.</li>\n</ul><h2>Service Animals</h2>\n\n<p>Service animals are permitted in the courthouse subject to federal ADA regulations. The ADA defines a \u201cservice animal\u201d as any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other disability. In certain situations, a service animal may include a miniature horse. The work or tasks performed by a service animal must be directly related to the handler\u2019s disability. Animals whose sole function is to provide comfort, emotional support, well-being, or companionship are not considered service animals under the ADA.

The bail amount is converted to community service work at a conversion rate of $4 per hour.</p>\n\n<p>The Traffic Clerk's Office will register an individual, if eligible, for community service work. If ineligible, the court will assist in setting up an affordable payment plan.</p>\n\n<p>An individual can register for community service work without going to court. A $50 administrative fee is payable at the time of registration. When registering for community service work, the court will determine the deadline for completion of the hours. <strong>If the hours are not completed, or the completed and signed time sheet is not turned in to the court by the due date, the community service hours will be automatically converted back to bail or a monetary fine and the case will be sent to court collections. The amount owed will be increased by a $100 civil assessment and other monetary sanctions, and the violator's driving privileges may be affected.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The court will provide the individual with a list of agencies eligible to oversee community service and a time sheet to record the hours worked. It is the responsibility of the individual to schedule the community service work, present the time sheet to the agency to obtain an authorized signature, and return the completed time sheet to the court by the due date. Individuals who live in Marin County but do not perform their community service work at agencies on the court's approved list may request the court to contact these agencies and verify the completion of the community service work with an additional $50 administrative fee for this service.</p>\n\n<p>Individuals who live outside of California are ineligible for community service work.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/sites/default/files/2018-09/TR001ninnCR001-COMMUNITYSERVICEWORKTIMESHEETnINSTRn3-16n_0.pdf\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Community Service Work Time Sheet</a></p>\n\n<h2>Financial Hardship</h2>\n\n<p>If you have a financial hardship you may ask the court to consider your ability to pay by submitting the \"Can't Afford to Pay Fine: Traffic and Other Infractions:\" (TR-320) along with associated documentation to the Clerk's Office.\u00a0 Below are links to the required forms to request the ability to pay determination.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/tr320.pdf\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TR-320 Can't Afford to Pay Fine: Traffic and Other Infractions and Information</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fw001.pdf\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FW-001 Request to Waive Court Fees</a></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n</div>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n  </div>\n\n</article>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockcard-elements-cards clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-card-elements-cards\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"flex view view-card-elements view-id-card_elements view-display-id-cards js-view-dom-id-e1ec94f7af0e2d20ed0248a1419aafcf95882e75fb3d6d22b082dbe7182069be\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blocktiles-element-tiles clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-tiles-element-tiles\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"view view-tiles-element view-id-tiles_element view-display-id-tiles js-view-dom-id-ad3798b5d163a0ddc7494dc2920a6dc7ba15532daaa7e65963873d40ccaa8482\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4 pad5\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n\n  </div>\n\n        \t\t\t\t</div>", "parent": null},

Under the law, once an attorney becomes a judge, his or her license to practice law is suspended during the term of judicial service.</p>\n\n<p>There are two ways that attorneys may become judges. They may be elected by the voters in the county in which they will serve in an open election or they may be appointed by the Governor to serve out the remaining term of an incumbent judge who leaves office before the end of his or her term. Judicial vacancies to be filled by the Governor may occur in a variety of ways including retirement or death of the incumbent; appointment of the incumbent to a judicial position in another superior court, such as a court in a neighboring county; or promotion of an incumbent to a judicial position in a higher court, like the Court of Appeal or Supreme Court. Superior court judges are elected to six year terms.</p>\n\n<p><b>Judge Verna A. Adams</b>\u00a0was appointed to the bench in 1999.

Sometimes children don't understand court and what happens there. Kids might think that court is a bad place because of what they hear from family, friends, or on TV. That is not true at all. There are many great things that go on in court, and you can learn more about them, here.</p>\n\n<h3>Getting to Know the Court</h3>\n\n<p>Do you know what the State Seal is, or who makes the laws? Have you ever wondered about the history of the Marin County Civic Center? Without Frank Lloyd Wright, we wouldn't have the Civic Center. Without the Civic Center, we wouldn't be able to solve problems. Who wants that? Not me!</p>\n\n<h3>Under the Blue Roof</h3>\n\n<p>Have you ever gone past a big building with a blue roof, in San Rafael? If you have, that's the Marin County Civic Center. There are a lot of things that go on in there, but one of the really important things is court. But did you know that there are different kinds of court? If you want to learn more, watch our movie \"Under the Blue Roof.\"</p>\n\n<h3>Who's Who in the Courtroom</h3>\n\n<p>A courtroom doesn't function all on its own. It takes a lot of important people to make sure our courts are a place where people are treated fairly. Take a look at this video to learn more about who's who in the court.</p>\n\n<h3>How Court Affects You and Me</h3>\n\n<p>Court is not only about helping adults. It's there to help you, too! Court always makes sure to put kids first, so remember, court is not as bad of a place as you might think it is. Kids can have a voice, too!</p>\n\n<h3>The Truth About Court</h3>\n\n<p>Do you like to watch TV? Have you ever seen a show about court? If you have, don't believe what you saw or heard. Many things on these shows are not what would really happen in court. They make court seem much worse than it really is. This video gives you the truth about court.</p>\n\n<dl class=\"ckeditor-accordion\"><dt>Behind the Scenes</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>Ever wonder about who created this website? There are writers, researchers, and overall hard workers who made this happen, and we'll tell you how and why they completed this project.</p>\n\n\t<ol><li><b>About Us</b><br>\n\t\tWho are the creators of this website?<br>\n\t\tTwenty-two fifth graders at Bel Aire School in Tiburon, California, made this website and the movies. They thought differently, and took risks -- some of the most important things you have to do if you want to create something new. A special thanks go to our teacher and our principal for leading the way to success!</li>\n\t\t<li><b>The Reason</b><br>\n\t\tWhat is the reason for this web page?<br>\n\t\tWe wanted to really show kids the true meaning of court. Also, we wanted to help children, who might have to go to court for any reason, feel more comfortable. We hope kids learn that court is a fair place, and that every decision that is made is for the good of each child.</li>\n\t\t<li><b>The Right Approach</b><br>\n\t\tHow did we approach this project?<br>\n\t\tWe worked in teams, with adults, and real court professionals to help get this project done. Not only did we study hard and stay focused, but we put our hearts into completing our goal to help kids like you.\u00a0</li>\n\t\t<li><b>Everybody Learns</b><br>\n\t\tWhat did we learn?<br>\n\t\tWe learned a lot about the court, designing movies, using correct grammar, editing, making web pages, writing reports, revising, working in teams, doing interviews, partnering with teachers and adults, working with community members, and much, much more. We hope that kids who see this website learn that court can be a friendly and safe place for them. Don't forget, there's even a dog!</li>\n\t\t<li><b>Something to Remember</b><br>\n\t\tHave you ever challenged yourself?<br>\n\t\tWe have! In fact, this project was about Challenged Based Learning, a style of learning designed to challenge students to produce something that's real and meaningful. We worked on this project for six months. Some teams had to do over 90 edits. We had a job to do, and we did it right. We learned more than we would have learned by just studying the court in a book. Without challenging yourself, you will never know what you can do. Go for it!</li>\n\t</ol><img alt=\"\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"2afea74c-557c-49f2-b159-c963d0ac6c20\" height=\"401\" src=\"/sites/default/files/marin/default_images/DSC_6893.jpeg\" width=\"603\" class=\"align-center\" loading=\"lazy\"><p>Contact Us @ Bel Aire School, 277 Karen Way Tiburon, CA 94920,\u00a0Phone\u00a0<a href=\"//tel:14153887100\">415-388-7100</a>,\u00a0fax\u00a0415-388-7176<br>\n\tEmail\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:belaire@reedschools.org\" target=\"_blank\">belaire@reedschools.org,</a>\u00a0Web Address\u00a0<a href=\"http://belaire.reedschools.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://belaire.reedschools.org</a></p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>Glossary</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p><b>New Words</b></p>\n\n\t<p>Every day, you learn something new.

The purposes of the detention hearing are for the judicial officer to:\n\n\t\t<ul><li>Decide whether your child can go home before the next hearing,</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Appoint an attorney for your child if you cannot afford one, and</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Read the petition containing the charges against your child into the court record.</li>\n\t\t</ul></li>\n\t</ul><p>If your child was arrested, but was not detained in Juvenile Hall, you will receive notice of an arraignment hearing in the mail.</p>\n\n\t<ul><li><strong>Pre-Trial Hearing: </strong>A pre-trial hearing will occur the day before trial to allow the parties in the matter to either resolve the case or to advise the Court that they are ready to proceed to trial.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Jurisdiction Hearing:</strong> At the jurisdiction hearing, the judicial officer will decide whether or not your child committed the offense.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Disposition Hearing:</strong> A disposition hearing is similar to a sentencing hearing in adult court. If the judicial officer finds that your child committed the offense, then at the disposition hearing the judicial officer will make orders that you and your child must abide by to resolve your child's delinquency case. Sometimes the disposition hearing is held right after the jurisdiction hearing, on the same day. Otherwise, it is held ten (10) court business days after the jurisdiction hearing.</li>\n\t</ul><p>In addition to the above hearings, you and your child may be required to attend any of the following hearings:</p>\n\n\t<ul><li><strong>Early Resolution Hearing:</strong> A court appearance is scheduled to try to resolve the matter prior to trial.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Hearings on Motions:</strong> There may be court appearances for the Court to hear additional issues that come up before the underlying case is resolved.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Fitness Hearing:</strong> If your child is at least 14 years old and is charged with committing certain serious crimes, the District Attorney may ask the Juvenile Court to make a decision on whether your child should be tried as an adult. At the fitness hearing, the judicial officer will decide whether your child will be tried in adult court or in juvenile court. (Note: Effective March 2000, a law was enacted giving the District Attorney authority in some instances to directly file complaints in adult court against minors 14 years of age and older who commit certain serious crimes.)</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Review Hearings: </strong>In some cases, the law or the Court may set hearings to review your child's progress and performance under supervision provided by the Probation Department, Juvenile Services Division.</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Restitution Hearing: </strong>If the Court so orders, you and your child may have to pay restitution to the victim. Restitution is money to compensate the victim for losses caused by your child's unlawful conduct. Examples of restitution might include the value of stolen or damaged property, medical expenses, and lost wages.</li>\n\t</ul></dd>\n\t<dt>My child got a traffic citation.

Chou,<br><em>Presiding Judge</em></p>\n\n<hr><h2>An Overview of Court Administration from James M. Kim, Court Executive Officer</h2>\n\n<p>The Court is a community institution, funded with public resources, and is vitally interested in providing excellent service to all who have reason to visit, whether in person or by phone, email or other correspondence. Court Administration is committed to continuous improvement of all of the court's programs, accessibility for all users, and especially public service.</p>\n\n<p>Court Administration welcomes complaints, comments and observations from individuals who have had an opportunity to interact with the court or its staff. Moreover, Court Administration is interested in suggestions and recommendations regarding how the court can better meet the needs of the public it serves. Please do not hesitate to contact Court Administration to provide this valuable feedback on the court's performance.</p>\n\n<h2>Governance Structure</h2>\n\n<p>Court Administration, also called the Office of the Court Executive, provides leadership, direction and oversight to all administrative and operational areas of the Court. The Court Executive Officer is appointed by the Judges and is responsible for ensuring that the court operates efficiently; is in compliance with laws, rules and procedures mandated by California law and the Judicial Council of California; and generally supports the work of judicial officers in adjudicating cases before the court. The Court Executive Officer is 'at will' and serves at the direction of the Presiding Judge. The Court Executive Officer is also the Clerk of the Court and the Jury Commissioner. James M. Kim is the Court Executive Officer and has been serving in this capacity since 2015.</p>\n\n<p>The Court Executive Officer works closely with the Presiding Judge to assure the effective and efficient operation of the Court. California Rules of Court, beginning at section 10.603, describe specific duties of the Presiding Judge and the Court Executive Officer in fulfilling their roles of management and oversight of the Court.</p>\n\n<h2>Purpose and Responsibilities</h2>\n\n<p>Acting at the direction of the Presiding Judge, Court Administration is responsible for the management and administration of the non-judicial operations of the Court. Specifically, Court Administration is responsible for allocating resources in a manner that promotes access to justice for all members of the public, provides a forum for the fair and expeditious resolution of disputes, maximizes the use of judicial and other resources, increases efficiency in court operations, and enhances service to the public.</p>\n\n<p>Court Administration's areas of responsibility are broad and diverse. They include:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Clerk's Offices for Criminal, Traffic, Civil, Small Claims, Family Law, Probate, and Juvenile matters;</li>\n\t<li>Courtroom Support, including courtroom staff, legal research, and interpreters;</li>\n\t<li>Records Management;</li>\n\t<li>Jury Services;</li>\n\t<li>Legal Self Help Services;</li>\n\t<li>Human Resources for all court employees, including training and professional development, and ADA accommodations for individuals with disabilities;</li>\n\t<li>Finance, including budget preparation, financial and grant reporting, accounts receivable, accounts payable, payroll, fund reconciliation, revenue distribution, procurement, facilities management and court collections;</li>\n\t<li>Information Technology, including network services, telecommunications, software deployment, disaster recovery, and application management;</li>\n\t<li>Family Court Services, including child custody, juvenile dependency mediation, and conservatorship and guardianship investigations;</li>\n\t<li>Court Security, including courtroom and perimeter services;</li>\n\t<li>Staffing of court-appointed committees and commissions;</li>\n\t<li>Public information distribution and press releases;</li>\n</ul><p>In addition to these duties, Court Administration also serves as liaison between the Court and the Judicial Council of California, which provides direction and assistance to all California Courts. The Court Executive Officer serves on several advisory committees and working groups that provide input to the Judicial Council of California in developing branch-wide policies to improve the administration of justice in California.</p>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n</div>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n  </div>\n\n</article>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockcard-elements-cards clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-card-elements-cards\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"flex view view-card-elements view-id-card_elements view-display-id-cards js-view-dom-id-8079367b1616b7060d765386523ffbcf6b12989dccc02f70b68f3bfb1c44d7d2\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blocktiles-element-tiles clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-tiles-element-tiles\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"view view-tiles-element view-id-tiles_element view-display-id-tiles js-view-dom-id-7ba43d22cdeb34631ab6cb0afde2ac48a133c22f776af96c31ba05539f0994f2\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4 pad5\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n\n  </div>\n\n        \t\t\t\t</div>", "parent": null},

To become eligible for pro tem reporter assignments, please send a resume, including CSR number, to the Court Reporter Coordinator.</p>\n\n<p>Certain types of hearings are not reported by a court reporter, but rather with an electronic recording device.

The cost of court reporting services will typically be borne by the parties.</p>\n\n<p>Generally, the court will not provide court reporters for the following types of proceedings: case management and status conferences; ex parte applications or hearings; orders to show cause; infractions and small claims. Court reporters may be used in such proceedings at the requesting parties' expense.</p>\n\n<p>Ten (10) court business days prior to the commencement of a civil, family law or probate trial or evidentiary hearing, parties are responsible for determining whether the court will have a court reporter available for the proceeding. Local form,\u00a0<a href=\"/node/392\" target=\"_blank\">Request for Court Reporting Services in Civil, Family Law and Probate Proceedings (form REP004)</a>, should be completed by parties or their attorneys to find out whether the court will be able to provide a reporter for a trial or hearing. If a court-provided court reporter is not available, parties may arrange for the presence of a certified shorthand reporter to serve as an official pro tem reporter at the parties\u2019 expense.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on how to request court reporting services, please review <a href=\"/node/458/\">Local Rule 1.18</a>.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<dl class=\"ckeditor-accordion\"><dt>Transcript Requests</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>There are two kinds of court records that reflect the actions taken in a particular case.\u00a0 The first is the court docket, also known as the register of actions.\u00a0 The register of actions is continually updated to reflect the parties and attorneys involved, new filed documents, appearance dates, and the actions that were taken in court hearings or alternative dispute resolution proceedings.\u00a0 Copies of the register of actions can be requested from the Court Records department for $0.50 per page.</p>\n\n\t<p>The second kind of court record is a transcript of court proceedings.\u00a0 Transcripts are verbatim records of everything said by the judge, attorneys, witnesses and others during a court hearing or trial. Court reporters are responsible for preparing transcripts of hearings as required by law or upon request. Except for those transcripts prepared for the court for certain criminal matters, all other parties requesting transcripts are required to pay reporters for preparation of transcripts at the rate prescribed by law. The rates that reporters may charge for transcripts, as well as other information about reporter transcripts, are contained in the <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes.xhtml\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Government Code, starting at section 69950</a>.

Court employees support a total of 14 judicial officers. As of January 1, 2001, the Court became an employer, separate from the County of Marin or the State of California. Court employment is governed by the Trial Court Employment Protection and Governance Act and is not covered by Civil Service Rules.</p>\n\n<p>The Court is an Equal Opportunity Employer and encourages applications from all persons regardless of their race, ethnic background, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, age or disability.</p>\n\n<h2>County of Marin</h2>\n\n<p>The County of Marin has a population of approximately 257,000 and covers 521 square miles. One of the nine Bay Area counties, Marin County is linked to San Francisco by the Golden Gate Bridge and to the East Bay by the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge. The county is recognized as one of the most enjoyable living areas in the country and has many state, county and city operated parks and recreational facilities, including China Camp State Park, Mt. Tamalpais State Park, Point Reyes National Seashore, and the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The Court is housed in the historic Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Marin County Civic Center.</p>\n\n<h2>Career Opportunities</h2>\n\n<p>For more information about the employment process, benefits of employment and professional development opportunities at the Court, please see the specific links below.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.governmentjobs.com/careers/marin\" target=\"_blank\">Career Opportunities</a></p>\n\n<dl class=\"ckeditor-accordion\"><dt>Employment Process</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p><b>Applications</b></p>\n\n\t<p>Completed applications must be received no later than 4:00 p.m. on the final filing date specified on the job announcement. Resumes will not be accepted in lieu of applications; however, applicants may submit resumes along with their completed applications.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Examination and Selection</b></p>\n\n\t<p>All completed application materials will be reviewed after the final filing date to determine if each applicant meets the stated desirable qualifications for the position. Applicants should take note that possession of the desirable qualifications is not necessarily a guarantee of further advancement in the employment process.</p>\n\n\t<p>Based upon the information provided in application materials, the most qualified applicants will be invited for further examination. Depending upon the number of applications received, the examination may consist of application screening, written test, performance or practical exam, oral interview, or any combination thereof.</p>\n\n\t<p>An eligibility list is then established by ranking candidates according to their overall score in the examination process. The eligibility list generally remains valid for up to six months and appointments are made from this list to fill all vacant positions in that classification.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Salary Policy and Probationary Period</b></p>\n\n\t<p>Appointments are usually made at the first step of the salary range. Depending on the position, candidates must successfully complete a probationary period of six or twelve months. Upon successful completion of the probationary period, newly hired employees achieve regular hire status.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt><b>Employee Benefits</b></dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p><b>Health Benefits</b></p>\n\n\t<p>The Court offers medical, dental and vision insurance coverage to employees and their dependents. There are Kaiser and Blue Cross medical plans to choose from, a dental plan provided by Delta Dental, and a vision plan provided by Vision Services Plan. Full-time employees receive a generous contribution to health insurance benefits while regularly scheduled part-time employees receive a prorated amount of the benefit contribution.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Life and Disability Insurance</b></p>\n\n\t<p>The Court provides a mandatory, basic term life insurance plan in the amount of $10,000, payable to a designated beneficiary. The Court also offers optional supplemental term life insurance, dependent life insurance and long-term disability insurance. For some employee groups, there is mandatory participation in the State Disability Insurance program.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Holidays and Paid Time Off</b></p>\n\n\t<p>Full-time employees receive eleven (11) paid holidays per year and, depending on the position, earn paid time off at a minimum rate of fourteen days per year for the first two years, with increases at designated intervals in subsequent years, based on employment longevity.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Sick Leave</b></p>\n\n\t<p>Full-time employees accrue twelve (12) days of sick leave per year, which may accumulate on an unlimited basis. Upon retirement, eligible employees may convert 75% of their unused, accrued sick leave balance to retirement service credit.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Flexible Spending Plans</b></p>\n\n\t<p>All employees are eligible to participate in a voluntary flexible spending plan which reimburses up to $5,000 per year for qualifying dependent care expenses and $3,050 per year for qualifying medical expenses.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Marin County Retirement Plan</b></p>\n\n\t<p>Court employees participate in the County of Marin's defined benefit retirement plan under the 1937 County Retirement Act. The specific plan depends on the employee\u2019s hire date and provisions of the Public Employees\u2019 Pension Reform Act of 2013 (PEPRA). All full-time employees and part-time employees who work a minimum of three-fourths time are enrolled in the plan. Plan benefits are based on age at time of retirement, years of service and compensation. The county retirement plan has reciprocity with other 1937 Act Retirement System organizations and California Public Employee Retirement System (Cal PERS.) Neither the Court nor the employee contributes to the federal Social Security system, but employees are required to withhold Medicare contributions.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Deferred Compensation Plan</b></p>\n\n\t<p>All court employees may participate in a voluntary Internal Revenue Code Section 457 deferred compensation plan paid 100% by the employee.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Tuition Reimbursement Program</b></p>\n\n\t<p>The Court offers a Tuition Reimbursement Program to employees who enroll in approved training courses or classes that directly relate to their present positions with the Court, or which may make employees more upwardly mobile in the Court. The Court's reimbursement program pays up to 50% of registration fees and materials, provided employees are pre-approved for their educational expenses and there are sufficient funds available in the Court's budget.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Employee Training and Development Program</b></p>\n\n\t<p>The Court is committed to a continuous learning environment where employees are encouraged to improve their knowledge and skills throughout their careers with the Court. Onsite programs are offered in such areas as Customer Service, Safety and Ergonomics in the Workplace and Using Microsoft Office Applications. The Court also is involved in regional and statewide training networks with other courts and professional organizations, making it possible for staff to participate in enriched training in particular functional areas of court processing.</p>\n\t</dd>\n</dl></div>\n          </div>\n  \n</div>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n  </div>\n\n</article>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockcard-elements-cards clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-card-elements-cards\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"flex view view-card-elements view-id-card_elements view-display-id-cards js-view-dom-id-a9f08b972bbcef4cf801ce1796ad10d1d97d646b16fcb147aae826a9b3a2d5f2\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blocktiles-element-tiles clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-tiles-element-tiles\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"view view-tiles-element view-id-tiles_element view-display-id-tiles js-view-dom-id-926cf449aff51d24697ce970c67c136db435caeffea4ffbe9847afdfe94ad328\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4 pad5\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n\n  </div>\n\n        \t\t\t\t</div>", "parent": null},

Criminal justice research on both the national and local levels has documented the challenges facing the criminal justice system when only punitive approaches are used to curtail criminal behavior. The research indicates that traditional criminal justice sentencing and probation strategies are often not effective with adult defendants and juvenile offenders who have underlying drug and alcohol problems, mental illness and behavioral disorders. Collaborative justice, also called therapeutic and problem solving courts, have been in operation in many parts of the country and California for more than a decade and have achieved some impressive results in identifying and resolving the underlying issues that often lead to criminal behavior. Through intensive monitoring of adult defendants and juveniles, they are often able to resolve their personal issues and are restored to leading law abiding lives. All therapeutic courts in Marin are 'post plea', meaning that defendants have to plead guilty before being admitted to the therapeutic court program to serve their probationary periods.</p>\n\n<p>As the name suggests, collaborative justice courts are designed using a collaborative or \"team\" approach. These programs have as their primary focus the offender, rather than victims or community. They are collaborative in that the programs set aside the adversarial processes of the traditional system, and allow defense attorneys, district attorneys, probation officers and treatment staff to work together to supervise program participants' behavior. While the judicial officer makes the final determination on what will happen in a given case, the \"team\" has more significant input than in a traditional system, and the expectation is that the collaboration of this group will lead to more effective decisions to assist an offender in making lasting changes in behavior. Team members strategize about how to provide more monitoring, support and services to these defendants to ensure that they comply with the terms of their probation and fulfill all therapeutic requirements of the program such as attendance at drug and alcohol programs, drug testing, regular medication monitoring, participation in batterers' programs and other activities designed to assist these individuals in establishing healthy, productive, law abiding lives.</p>\n\n<h2>Restorative Courts</h2>\n\n<p>The philosophy of restorative justice acknowledges that crime injures victims and their families, offenders and their families, and communities. Restorative courts seek to \"repair the harm\" caused by the crime. Restorative justice is based on principles of offender accountability to victims and community protection. Restorative practices have been proven to be effective with youthful offenders, since the nature of these crimes is often less serious than crimes committed by adult offenders. Youth courts are in operation across the country and these courts are growing in popularity.</p>\n\n<dl class=\"ckeditor-accordion\"><dt>Youth Court</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>The Youth Transforming Justice Youth Court is an alternative to the traditional juvenile justice system. The Youth Court\u2019s transformative power is derived from its non-adversarial, peer-to-peer restorative practices. Based on the principles of restorative justice Youth Court empowers youth to take an active role in addressing and supporting their peers when they have acknowledged accountability for breaking the law. The goal of restorative justice is to repair the harm done, the relationships impacted, and provide the young person with increased skills so they may reengage the community as a more reflective and wiser person.</p>\n\n\t<p>Diverting over a thousand youth since its inception in 2004, Youth Court is on the forefront of mitigating the school-to-prison pipeline by using restorative practices that keep kids in school and out of the juvenile justice system. This innovative program has a 95% completion rate and successful completion of the program can remove their juvenile record.</p>\n\n\t<p>The Marin County Youth Court is administered by the Youth Transforming Justice nonprofit in collaboration with the Superior Court, District Attorney's Office, Office of the Public Defender, Probation Department, Marin County Bar Association and the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Commission among other county, statewide, and national partners.</p>\n\n\t<p>Under the leadership of Don Carney, Youth Transforming Justice, Marin Youth Court has become a strong and sustainable program.</p>\n\n\t<p>If you would like to volunteer with the Youth Court or for more information about Youth Court, please contact Don Carney at <a href=\"//tel:14156861356\">(415) 686-1356</a> or at\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:dcarney@ymcasf.org\"><strong>dcarney@ymcasf.org</strong></a><b>.</b></p>\n\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/marinyouthcourt/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Like us on Facebook!</b></a>.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>Adult Drug Court</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>The mission of the Marin County Adult Drug Court is to improve lives that have been impacted by substance use, and to increase public safety by reducing the amount and frequency of drug related crime. The Court aims to reduce criminal recidivism by facilitating treatment and rehabilitation. The Court provides increased supervision to individuals with a substance use disorder involved in the criminal justice system, thereby returning individuals to the community better equipped to maintain their recovery and not engage in further criminal behavior.</p>\n\n\t<p>The Adult Drug Court Team includes a judicial officer, probation officer, deputy district attorney, deputy public defender, and treatment providers who provide clinical assessments and drug and counseling services.</p>\n\n\t<p>Participants in the Adult Drug Court are required to meet regularly with a probation officer, case manager, and assessment specialist. Participants engage in self-help meetings and substance use treatment. Participants shall submit to urine analysis tests whenever ordered to do so and shall make regular court appearances. The program consists of 4 phases, each with its own set of legal, housing, vocational, and treatment requirements. The program typically takes about 12 months to complete successfully. When a participant graduates from the Adult Drug Court he or she may have drug related charges(s) dismissed, reduced, jail sentence stayed and/or probation terminated.</p>\n\n\t<p>For a description of Adult Drug Court, how the program works and what is required of participants, please\u00a0<a href=\"/sites/default/files/marin/misc_files/ADC_Policy_and_Procedures.pdf\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">click here\u00a0to see the Adult Drug Court participant brochure</a>.</p>\n\n\t<p>To obtain further information, please contact Dr. Suz Mitchell at Marin County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services at <a href=\"//tel:14154732543\">(415) 473-2543</a>.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>STAR (Mental Health) Court</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p><b>Support and Treatment After Release (STAR) Court</b></p>\n\n\t<p>STAR Court is a court-supervised program for defendants who have serious mental illnesses, which require medication, treatment and other services, and who choose to participate in STAR Court as an alternative to traditional supervised probation. The goal of STAR Court is to decrease the frequency of clients' contacts with the criminal justice system by improving their social functioning skills and by linking them to employment, housing, regular treatment, and support services.</p>\n\n\t<p>STAR Court works in collaboration with Marin County's STAR Program, which is a full service partnership providing culturally competent, intensive, integrated services to mentally ill offenders. Clients typically must first be in the STAR Court before they become eligible to participate in the STAR Program.</p>\n\n\t<p>The STAR Court Team includes a Judicial Officer, Probation Officer, Deputy District Attorney, Deputy Public Defender, STAR Program Supervisor, Forensic-Clinical Psychologist, Social Workers, Nurse Practitioner, Psychiatrist, Family Liaison, Marin County Sheriff Re-entry Team Deputy, Therapists, Peer Support Staff, and a Vocational Consultant.</p>\n\n\t<p>Clients must sign an agreement to abide by the rules of STAR Court and the individual treatment plan developed by the STAR Court Team. Typical agreements require participants to attend regular court sessions; take prescribed medications faithfully; meet with a social worker regularly; lead law abiding lives; participate in treatment plans; and, comply with the STAR Court Team's directives. When a participant graduates from STAR Court, he or she may have the underlying case reduced or dismissed and probation terminated.</p>\n\n\t<p>STAR Court consists of 3 phases (typically 6-months per phase), each with a set of legal, housing, vocational, and treatment components.

The rules are relatively simple and the hearings are less formal. Parties in small claims actions can resolve their disputes relatively quickly and inexpensively. The person who files the claim is called the plaintiff and the person being sued is called the defendant.</p>\n\n<p>Plaintiffs filing in Small Claims Court cannot seek judgments of more than $10,000 for individuals and $5,000 for businesses. An individual who owns a business (e.g. sole proprietor) and does business under a fictitious business name is considered to be an \"individual\" in Small Claims Court. For example, a plumber doing business as ABC Plumbing who wants to sue a customer who has not paid for services may file a claim for up to $10,000 with certain exceptions. If a business is a corporation, partnership or any other type of entity than a sole proprietorship, the maximum claim amount in Small Claims Court cannot exceed $5,000.</p>\n\n<p>California law states that plaintiffs may file as many claims as they like for up to $2,500 each calendar year. However, plaintiffs can only file two claims in a calendar year that seek more than $2,500 per claim.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note: Filing a small claim in this Court may be done in person, by mail, or electronically through the <a href=\"/node/470\">eDelivery</a> portal.</strong></p>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n</div>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n  </div>\n\n</article>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockcard-elements-cards clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-card-elements-cards\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"flex view view-card-elements view-id-card_elements view-display-id-cards js-view-dom-id-2be138186683005523946a8b22b1d738f144aa5e73a6838d703d371c8ddee61b\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blocktiles-element-tiles clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-tiles-element-tiles\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"view view-tiles-element view-id-tiles_element view-display-id-tiles js-view-dom-id-64ab0724a7ea9d5f7e864f5ce907cdfb652753da5bacfcb168dccaca9345820f\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4 pad5\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n\n  </div>\n\n        \t\t\t\t</div>", "parent": null},

History of Legal Self Help Center</h2>\n\n<p>Many years ago, as a result of the increasing number of self-represented litigants using the legal system, the leaders of the California Court, under the direction of the Chief Justice, began to implement programs to establish Legal Self Help Centers in every court throughout the State of California.</p>\n\n<p>In Marin County, legal assistance for self-represented litigants is provided by Legal Self Help Center (LSHC), a division of the Marin Superior Court. This program was established in 2003 and was conceived by the Court working together with numerous legal service providers and other community agencies. Over the course of those years, tens of thousands of Marin residents have received assistance with their legal matters.</p>\n\n<p>LSHC provides a variety of services including assistance with form preparation, provision of legal information, and referrals to governmental and community-based legal and social organizations. At LSHC, we believe that educating litigants about the court process and basic legal principles can help minimize their stress, improve their ability to settle out-of-court, and ultimately obtain a timely and equitable resolution of their legal matters.\u00a0</p>\n\n<dl class=\"ckeditor-accordion\"><dt>More Information About Legal Self Help</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>Legal Self Help Center (LSHC) provides free assistance to those who do not have attorneys.

The child called the \"minor\" or \"ward,\" must be under 18. A legal guardian is an adult the court chooses to be responsible for and care for a child, manage the child's property, or both.</p>\n\n<p>A guardianship of the estate allows the guardian to make financial decisions for a child and is often filed when a minor is to receive a large monetary gift or inheritance. Both parents and non-parents can become guardians of the estate for children. In guardianships of the estate, the court may require that the funds be placed into a blocked account in which withdrawals are allowed only with prior court approval.</p>\n\n<p>The law requires that the court conduct an investigation of anyone seeking to become a guardian. There is a fee this investigation.</p>\n\n<h2>Temporary Guardianship</h2>\n\n<p>On occasion, a temporary guardianship may be appropriate if there is an emergency that requires an immediate appointment, prior to the guardianship hearing date. A petition for temporary\u00a0guardianship can be filed at the same time as the petition for limited or general guardianship. It may not be filed separately from a guardianship. A Petition for Appointment of a Temporary Guardian should have all information supporting the need for emergency orders, including copies of all relevant medical, police, or Adult Protective Services reports.</p>\n\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n\n<p>Once appointed by the court, a guardian must complete several steps before the Clerk of the Court can issue Letters of Guardianship. The Letters of Guardianship are the documents that verify you have been legally appointed to act as the guardian for a child.

This property is called a \"decedent's estate.\" The court supervises the assets and liabilities of people who die while residents of California or who leave property inside the state including payment of the deceased person's debts and the distribution of property to beneficiaries. A deceased person's estate will not be handled in probate court if there is property held in joint tenancy with another person. Property transferred by gift before death, or placed into certain types of \"living trusts,\" also is not subject to probate. If the person has written a will at the time of death, he is said to have died \"testate.\" If there was no will, the person is said to have died \"intestate.\"</p>\n\n<p>If no will exists, the property (\"estate\") is divided among the decedent's heirs. In California, if the decedent has a spouse and/or children, the property first goes to them. If there is no spouse or children, the property goes to the decedent's next nearest relatives. In these cases, the court will appoint an administrator to manage and distribute the assets. This person is known as the \"administrator.\"</p>\n\n<p>If there is a will, the court will make sure it is valid. The property is then distributed as directed by the will. The person who oversees the estate under the terms of the will is usually the person who is named to be the executor in the will. If the will does not name an executor or the person named in the will does not want to serve in that way, the court will appoint someone to manage and distribute the assets.</p>\n\n<h2>Trusts</h2>\n\n<p>The court also hears matters pertaining to living and testamentary trusts. The person(s) charged with administering the trust, called \"trustees\" are required to distribute assets as described in the trust instrument. The individuals who will benefit from the trust are called \"beneficiaries.\"</p>\n\n<p>Trustees, beneficiaries, or the trust may petition the court to remove the trustee, release assets held by the trustee, amend the trust instrument, appoint successor trustees, appoint receivers, notify creditors, and make other orders necessary to ensure the timely and appropriate distribution of the trust's assets.</p>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n</div>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n  </div>\n\n</article>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockcard-elements-cards clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-card-elements-cards\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"flex view view-card-elements view-id-card_elements view-display-id-cards js-view-dom-id-56473949d8e4610027cf8b8645b7995ee6fc022e3e939cba20181fac08cbfc96\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blocktiles-element-tiles clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-tiles-element-tiles\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"view view-tiles-element view-id-tiles_element view-display-id-tiles js-view-dom-id-e7b3c1ea43dde1986092f814f0d8f5938db925d3ca5631d991f41a1ffd076229\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4 pad5\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n\n  </div>\n\n        \t\t\t\t</div>", "parent": null},

For example, enter\u00a0<i>James A. Jones and Sally R. Jones</i>\u00a0on your claim. Do not list parties as Mr. and Mrs. Jones. Each individual must be listed on a separate Defendant line.</li>\n\t\t<li><b>If you are suing as a result of a vehicle accident</b>, name both the registered owner and the driver. If the owner and driver are the same person enter,\u00a0<i>Sam Jones, owner and driver</i>\u00a0on your claim. If the owner and driver are not the same enter,\u00a0<i>Lucy Smith, owner and Betty Smith, driver</i>\u00a0on your claim. Each individual must be listed on a separate Defendant line.</li>\n\t\t<li><b>If you are suing a company owned by one person</b>, enter both the owner's and the company's name. You should also name the owner as an individual to increase your chances of collecting the judgment. Enter the letters \"dba\" which stands for \"doing business as\" between the name of the owner and the company name if the owner is doing business under a fictitious business name. For example, enter\u00a0<i>Sue Smith, individually &amp; dba Continental Candies</i>\u00a0on your claim.</li>\n\t\t<li><b>If you are suing a partnership</b>, name both the partnership and the partners as individuals. For example, enter\u00a0<i>Jim Smith, individually and John Jones individually, and dba Smith &amp; Jones</i>\u00a0on your claim. If you win your case, you will then be able to collect from either the partnership or the individual partners or both. Each individual must be listed on a separate Defendant line.</li>\n\t\t<li><b>If you are suing a corporation</b>, enter the exact name of the corporation. For example,\u00a0<i>Sally's Dresses, a corporation</i>\u00a0or\u00a0<i>Sally's Dresses, Inc</i>. If a corporation owns a division or subsidiary you should designate the corporation as 'doing business as' the subsidiary.

Be sure to bring your original claim forms with you. If any of the defendants have been served on the original claim, you will need to ask the Court for permission to amend your claim at the time of the hearing.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Dismissing a Claim</strong></p>\n\n\t<p>To dismiss the claim against one or more defendants or all of the defendants, use the dismissal form in the small claims packet or\u00a0<a href=\"/sites/default/files/marin/small_claims/SC005.pdf\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">click here\u00a0to get a copy of the form</a>.</p>\n\n\t<p>Follow the instructions on the form.

The continuance may be requested by either party. The Court must receive the written request either in person or by mail, along with a continuance fee.

To obtain further continuances to serve the defendant(s), plaintiffs must appear in person on the hearing date to make the request before the judicial officer.

Without a witness, parties will need documents, photos or other records to prove their case.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>If a witness will not come to court voluntarily, or will not voluntarily provide the documents or records you need</b>, you may subpoena the witness. A subpoena is a court order which compels a person to come to court. A subpoena duces tecum is a court order which compels a person to bring certain papers or records to court. These documents must be delivered to the Court on or before the date of the trial.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>You may obtain a subpoena or a subpoena duces tecum</b>\u00a0from the Court. There is no fee for the issuance of a subpoena or a subpoena duces tecum. A copy of the subpoena must be delivered to the witness personally. Anyone, including you, may deliver the subpoena. You must return the original subpoena (the one with the seal on it) to the Court at the time of hearing. You must serve the copy of the subpoena on the witness.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>A witness may ask for fees</b>\u00a0of $35 per day and $0.20 per mile each way for coming to court. Witness fees for peace officers are greater. If a witness asks for fees, the witness does not have to appear at the court hearing if the fees are not paid. The person who serves the subpoena should be prepared to pay the fees at the time of service if they are requested. If the witness does not ask for fees, you do not have to offer them.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>To subpoena documents or other papers</b>, you will need to know exactly which documents or papers you are seeking. A subpoena duces tecum must be served with a copy of a declaration, completed by you, describing the documents you need. The declaration is part of the subpoena that the clerk will give you.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>After the subpoena is served</b>, a completed proof of service form, along with the original subpoena, must be presented to the judicial officer at the time of the hearing. Do not deliver these documents to the Clerk's Office.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt><b>How to Appeal a Small Claim Judgment</b></dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>An appeal of a small claim judgment is a request to the Court to reverse the decision made in the Small Claims Court by having the case heard again, by a different judicial officer. If the party requesting the appeal is entitled to a new hearing, the case will be transferred to the Small Claims Appeal Clerk to set a hearing date. Please note you may not appeal the judgment on your own claim. In certain circumstances, plaintiffs may request that the Court cancel, correct or vacate a judgment if there is a clerical error or if the case was decided on an erroneous legal basis, but these situations are rare.</p>\n\n\t<p>An appeal of a small claim judgment must be filed within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of the judicial decision or, if the decision is mailed, within thirty (30) calendar days of the date the clerk mailed the Notice of Entry of Judgment. The date will appear on the notice. The filing fee must be paid to the Court when filing the Notice of Appeal. <a href=\"/sites/default/files/Jan%202022%20MCSC%20Schedule%20-%20web%20copy__0.pdf\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">For the amount of the filing fee, please\u00a0click here</a><a href=\"/sites/default/files/marin/small_claims/filingFees.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">.</a></p>\n\n\t<p>The appeal is heard in the Court and is treated as a new case. Parties must present all of the evidence and witnesses again.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Small Claims Appeal General Information.</b></p>\n\n\t<p><b>An insurer of the defendant</b>\u00a0may appeal a judgment if the judgment exceeds $2,500 and the defendant's policy with the insurer covers the matter to which the judgment applies.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>On appeal,</b>\u00a0the claim is heard for the original amount. For example, if the defendant was sued for $1,000 and the judgment against the defendant was for $500, on an appeal the judge has the right to award the full $1,000 to the plaintiff if the defendant loses.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>While the case is being appealed,</b>\u00a0the defendant does not have to pay the small claim judgment.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>If the defendant loses the appeal,</b>\u00a0the defendant must pay the plaintiff the amount of the judgment plus interest and costs. Examples of costs are any earnings the plaintiff can prove were lost or any money the plaintiff actually paid for transportation and lodging in connection with the appeal. The defendant may also have to pay the plaintiff's attorney's fees up to $150.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>If the Court finds</b>\u00a0that the appeal was intended to harass or delay the plaintiff, or to encourage the plaintiff to abandon the claim, the Court may award the plaintiff attorney's fees of up to $1,000 and any actual lost earnings. The Court may, if it wishes, award the cost of lodging and transportation incurred in connection with the appeal up to $1,000, following a hearing on the matter.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt><b>Small Claim Appeals - Frequently Asked Questions</b></dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>For more information, see the <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-smallclaims.htm\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">California Small Claims Courts Information Center by\u00a0clicking here</a>.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>How do I get a continuance date for my small claim appeal?</strong></p>\n\n\t<p>Requests for continuances must be made at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the hearing date. The Court requires both sides to agree to a continuance. This means the party requesting the continuance must call or write the other party and request permission to continue the hearing date. You should first call the Small Claims Appeal Desk <a href=\"/small-claims/tel:14154447130\">(415) 444-7130</a> to obtain the next available dates so you may discuss them with the other party.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Is there a charge to continue the small claim appeal hearing?</strong></p>\n\n\t<p>Yes. The requesting party must send the Court a $20.00 processing fee and confirmation letter stating the agreed upon date. A copy of this letter must be mailed to the other party.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>What if the other party will not agree to the continuance?</strong></p>\n\n\t<p>Write a letter to the Small Claims Appeal Desk. In that letter, state the reason for the continuance and that you were unable to get an agreement from the other side. The letter will be routed to the Supervising Civil Judge to determine whether the continuance should be granted. A copy of this letter must be mailed to the other party.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Am I allowed the have an attorney represent me?</strong></p>\n\n\t<p>Yes, you may retain an attorney. The Court must be informed of the name, address, and phone number of your attorney, should you retain one.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>What if the case settles or the appellant wishes to withdraw the appeal prior to the hearing?</strong></p>\n\n\t<p>Please call the Small Claims Appeals Desk <a href=\"/small-claims/tel:14154447130\">(415) 444-7130</a> and inform the clerk of the settlement or withdrawal of the appeal. It is the appellant's obligation to file a \"Request For Dismissal\" form with the Court if the case settles or is withdrawn before trial.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>The exhibits in my small claim case were not returned to me and I need them for the small claim appeal.

If further commitment is determined to be necessary, subsequent petitions for commitment may be filed in the same manner as the original petition.</p>\n\n<h2>Establishment of Fact of Birth, Death, or Marriage</h2>\n\n<p>Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, the court may make findings to establish the fact of a birth, death, or marriage where such an event has not been officially recorded or other official documentation cannot be obtained. In addition, the court will typically establish the date of the event and will notify, by certified copy, the California Department of Public Health, Office of Vital Records.</p>\n\n<h2>Minor's Compromise</h2>\n\n<p>The court may approve the terms of an agreement to settle a claim by a child, usually involving an injury.</p>\n\n<h2>Riese (Mental Capacity) Hearings</h2>\n\n<p>California Welfare and Institutions Code, starting at section 5332, sets forth a procedure in which a licensed physician may request a hearing to determine whether a person involuntarily committed to a mental health facility who refuses anti-psychotic medication has the capacity to make rational decisions about his own medical treatment. If the hearing officer determines that the patient does not have this capacity, he may be ordered by the court to take the prescribed medication. County Counsel files the petition on behalf of the medical provider. Because of the urgent nature of these petitions, hearings are typically scheduled at the mental health facility within 24 hours of the physician's request.</p>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n</div>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n  </div>\n\n</article>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockcard-elements-cards clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-card-elements-cards\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"flex view view-card-elements view-id-card_elements view-display-id-cards js-view-dom-id-3b8619a80e1c6fe11e47cf9c769fe9ff101d8bd9aa13815bf36ae92685c303ea\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blocktiles-element-tiles clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-tiles-element-tiles\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"view view-tiles-element view-id-tiles_element view-display-id-tiles js-view-dom-id-2dd6777c43bcc9f8e69873b5e9d1f47fd0d64a61246d3e8952cd57b03098ca56\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4 pad5\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n\n  </div>\n\n        \t\t\t\t</div>", "parent": null},

A person or organization the judicial officer appoints to do this is known as the \"conservator.\" A conservator can be a family member, friend or professional person. The person who cannot care for him or herself is called the \"conservatee.\"</p>\n\n<p>A conservatorship of the person ends when the conservatee dies or the conservatee regains the ability to handle his or her own personal affairs. A conservatorship of the estate ends when the Court terminates the conservatorship.</p>\n\n<p>There are two types of conservatorships:</p>\n\n<ul><li>A\u00a0<b>Limited Probate Conservatorship</b>\u00a0applies when the conservatee is developmentally disabled. In this type of conservatorship, the powers of the conservator are limited so that the disabled person may live as independently as possible.</li>\n\t<li>A\u00a0<b>General Probate Conservatorship</b>\u00a0is for all other adults who are unable to provide for their personal needs due to physical injury, advanced age, dementia, or other conditions rendering them incapable of caring for themselves or making them subject to undue influence.</li>\n</ul><p>Once a Petition for Conservatorship has been filed, the Court will appoint an attorney for the proposed\u00a0<span class=\"ILfuVd\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\"><span class=\"hgKElc\">conservatee, and</span></span> will set the matter for hearing. Court investigators are assigned to interview all persons who are the subject of a petition for conservatorship before the first hearing is held. The court investigator may interview numerous family members, neighbors and others to provide as much information as possible to the Court to assist in making a determination as to whether to grant the conservatorship. When interviewing the proposed conservatee, the purpose of the interview is to determine whether the person understands the proceedings or has any objections to them.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to appointment a conservator must complete the following:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Complete and retain a copy of the form\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/gc348.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Duties of Conservator and Acknowledgment of Receipt of \u201cHandbook for Conservators\"</a>\u00a0(Judicial Council Form GC-348).

These conservatees may be a danger to themselves or others. The conservator is responsible for helping to find a placement and mental health treatment for the conservatee who is gravely disabled.</p>\n\n\t<p>An LPS conservatorship is used only when the person needs mental health treatment but cannot or will not accept it voluntarily. Because the person subject to an LPS conservatorship may be placed in a locked facility, there are special protections to ensure that the conservatee's civil rights are protected. By law, these cases are treated as confidential.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>\n\t<p><b>Temporary Conservatorship</b></p>\n\t</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>On occasion, a temporary conservatorship may be appropriate if there is an emergency that requires an immediate appointment, prior to the conservatorship hearing date. A petition for temporary conservatorship can be filed at the same time as the petition for limited or general conservatorship. It may not be filed separately from a conservatorship. A Petition for Appointment of a Temporary Conservator should have all information supporting the need for emergency orders, including copies of all relevant medical, police, or Adult Protective Services reports.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt><b>Resources</b></dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>Further assistance is available from the\u00a0<a href=\"http://courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-conservatorship.htm\" target=\"_blank\">California Courts Online Self-Help Center</a>.</p>\n\t</dd>\n</dl></div>\n          </div>\n  \n</div>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n  </div>\n\n</article>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockcard-elements-cards clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-card-elements-cards\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"flex view view-card-elements view-id-card_elements view-display-id-cards js-view-dom-id-b69e998f6e926f51451dc3a9b6792ebb969cdf190cd499cfc8ab376d94771811\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blocktiles-element-tiles clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-tiles-element-tiles\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"view view-tiles-element view-id-tiles_element view-display-id-tiles js-view-dom-id-eee3675589d9bfa046a47ae63e90b111937571fa82138b0ebe228a174e693691\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4 pad5\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n\n  </div>\n\n        \t\t\t\t</div>", "parent": null},

The services of the Family Law Facilitator include: distributing court forms and voluntary declarations of paternity, providing assistance to parties in completing forms, preparing child and spousal support calculations, as well as mediation of support matters. The Family Law Facilitator also provides referrals to the Department of Child Support Services, Family Court Services, and other community agencies providing services to families.

There is no confidential attorney-client relationship between a party and the Family Law Facilitator.

It is the duty and responsibility of all qualified citizens to participate as jurors.</p>\n\n<p>In order for the justice process to be fair, equal and accessible to all, judicial officers and jurors must consider the cases before them in a way that is thoughtful, involves sound judgment, is impartial and fair, and demonstrates integrity.</p>\n\n<p>In each trial, the judicial officer determines the rules of law that govern the case. For example, the judicial officer decides what evidence may be presented and admitted during the trial. After listening carefully and considering all of the testimony and evidence presented, jurors receive instructions from the judicial officer as to the laws that apply to the case. At this time, the responsibility switches to the jurors and they decide which facts in the case are most credible and then apply the law as instructed by the judicial officer in order to reach a verdict.</p>\n\n<p>\"Serving on a jury is a memorable experience and truly an honor.\"</p>\n\n<p>Former Juror Adam C.</p>\n\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING COVID-19</strong>\u00a0- The Court has a constitutional duty to remain open to serve the needs of the community to the greatest extent possible, even in the face of a potential COVID-19 outbreak. However, the Court is working with counsel and litigants to minimize the need to call in jurors, reduce the number of jurors summoned and comply with CDC and Marin County Public Health guidelines concerning safe distances and assemblies. The Court is also granting requests for deferrals and postponements remotely -- even for jurors who have previously made such a request -- for all potential jurors who are high risk or under medical or other business directives. The Court will continue to monitor the situation and will make ongoing adjustments as the direction of Marin County Public Health and the needs of the community dictate. Jurors who are not feeling well are encouraged to stay home and may contact Jury Services to reschedule their jury duty. You can postpone your jury duty electronically by\u00a0<a href=\"https://jury.marin.courts.ca.gov/login\" target=\"_blank\">logging into the jury system</a>\u00a0using your Juror ID and PIN provided to you on your jury summons. Jury clerks are also available by phone at <a href=\"//tel:14154447120\">(415) 444-7120</a>, between the hours of 1:00 to 3:00 PM, and by email at\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:jury@marin.courts.ca.gov\">jury@marin.courts.ca.gov</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>FRAUD ALERT</strong>\u00a0- The State of California has issued public warnings about calls from individuals claiming to be court officials or law enforcement officers regarding jury service. The Court DOES NOT call, e-mail, or send letters requesting money or personal identifying information regarding jury service. If you are concerned that you are being targeted by this scam, please contact our Jury Services Division at <a href=\"//tel:14154447120\">(415) 444-7120</a> or send us an email at\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:jury@marin.courts.ca.gov\">jury@marin.courts.ca.gov.</a></p>\n\n<dl class=\"ckeditor-accordion\"><dt><b>What is a Jury Trial?</b></dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>During a trial, the judicial officer serves as the Court's presiding officer and is the final authority on questions of law. The lawyers act as advocates for their clients. Jurors listen to opening statements and closing arguments presented by the lawyers and also learn about and weigh the evidence that is introduced during the trial. After hearing all of the evidence and arguments, jurors retire to a private room to begin their deliberations. The purpose of juror deliberations is to allow the jurors to make a decision about the questions presented in the case and then render a verdict.</p>\n\n\t<p>Juries are called to hear two types of cases: civil and criminal.</p>\n\n\t<ul><li><b>Civil cases</b>\u00a0involve disputes between people or organizations. They may involve property or personal rights, such as landlord/tenant issues, personal injury, contract disputes, and employment rights.</li>\n\t\t<li><b>Criminal cases</b>\u00a0are tried on behalf of the People of the State of California and are usually prosecuted by the District Attorney's Office. Prosecutors file criminal cases against individuals accused of committing crimes.</li>\n\t</ul></dd>\n\t<dt><b>Selection of a Jury</b></dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>When a jury trial is about to begin, the judicial officer requests a panel of prospective jurors to be sent to the courtroom from Jury Services so that the jury selection process can begin. After reporting to a courtroom, the prospective jurors are first asked to swear that they will truthfully answer all questions asked regarding their qualifications to serve as jurors in the case.</p>\n\n\t<p>The law permits the judicial officer and attorneys to excuse individual jurors from service for various reasons. If a lawyer wants to have a juror excused, he or she must use a \"challenge\" to excuse the juror. Challenges can be \"for cause\" - meaning that a reason is stated - or \"peremptory\" - meaning that no reason is required by the Court. The process of questioning and excusing jurors continues until 12 persons are chosen as jurors for the trial. Alternate jurors may also be selected. The judicial officer and attorneys agree that these jurors are qualified to decide impartially and intelligently the factual issues in the case. When the selection of the jury is complete, the jurors take an oath, promising to reach a verdict based only upon the evidence presented in the trial and the Court's instructions about the law.</p>\n\n\t<p>The duty and responsibility of every juror is as important as the judicial officer's in making sure that justice is done. <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/juryservice.htm\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">For more information regarding jury service in California,\u00a0click here</a>.</p>\n\t</dd>\n</dl></div>\n          </div>\n  \n</div>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n  </div>\n\n</article>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockcard-elements-cards clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-card-elements-cards\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"flex view view-card-elements view-id-card_elements view-display-id-cards js-view-dom-id-920d8ca6eaf5f729ddcd38bfe5bb584c37601e98e46cf431e81b80af5ef577cf\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blocktiles-element-tiles clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-tiles-element-tiles\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"view view-tiles-element view-id-tiles_element view-display-id-tiles js-view-dom-id-ee211d99873cf8ad8e347bccccdb1c8a2ba8573bc871ef5e83f4526f4c5aed0e\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4 pad5\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n\n  </div>\n\n        \t\t\t\t</div>", "parent": null},

The first is \"irreconcilable differences,\" meaning that at least one party asserts that the marriage cannot be saved. The other reason is \"incurable insanity\" which, unlike irreconcilable differences, must be proven.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Dissolution of Marriage (Divorce):</b>\u00a0A dissolution of marriage, which is more commonly known as divorce, ends the marriage and resolves marital issues including child custody, visitation, child support, spousal support, asset and debt division (real and personal property), former name restoration, restraining orders, and other issues identified by the parties.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Summary Dissolution:</b>\u00a0If you and your spouse are in agreement that you want to divorce you may be able to obtain a summary dissolution. The criteria for a summary dissolution include:</p>\n\n\t<ul><li>You were married for under five (5) years</li>\n\t\t<li>There were no children born during the marriage</li>\n\t\t<li>You have very few community assets and debts</li>\n\t</ul><p><a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/fl810.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">For more information about this option, which is less complicated than a regular dissolution of marriage,\u00a0click here</a>.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Legal Separation:</b>\u00a0Legal separation is similar to dissolution of marriage, except that the parties remain married to each other. The court may make orders regarding the same issues identified in a dissolution of marriage.</p>\n\n\t<p>If you open a legal separation action, you may amend your petition before a judgment is entered to request a dissolution of marriage.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Nullity:</b>\u00a0A nullity is more commonly known as an annulment of marriage. This may only be requested if a party alleges incest, bigamy, minor without parental consent, unsound mind, fraud, force, or incapacity to consummate the marriage.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Domestic Partnerships:</b>\u00a0If you want to end a registered California domestic partnership, you may be able to do that directly through the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.sos.ca.gov/registries/domestic-partners-registry\" target=\"_blank\">Secretary of State\u2019s Domestic Partner Registry</a>. If you do not qualify for the out-of-court process, you need to file a petition in the superior court. If you are not married to your domestic partner, neither party has to live in California. If you are married, you may end the marriage and the domestic partnership at the same time, but one of you must meet California\u2019s residency requirements.\u00a0</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Child and Spousal Support Enforcement:</b>\u00a0To establish parentage, obtain child support orders, or enforce existing child, spousal, or family support orders, the Department of Child Support Services (DCSS) is available to assist you.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.marincounty.org/depts/cs\" target=\"_blank\">Click here\u00a0for information about this office</a>.

Parties are required to pay for these investigations.<a href=\"https://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-adoption.htm\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\u00a0Click here\u00a0for more information on the requirements for adoptions</a>.

The court may make findings of parental relationship in these matters that will have an effect on child support, visitation and custody.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Child Custody, Support and Visitation:</b>\u00a0Even after marital and domestic partnership issues have been resolved, the court retains jurisdiction over issues that affect minor children in these proceedings until these children reach the age of 18. Parties may file motions to modify custody, support and visitation any time the circumstances warrant such filings.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Termination of Parental Rights:</b>\u00a0In limited circumstances, such as adoptions or juvenile-dependency cases, the court may find that a parent is unable or unwilling to care for and support his/her children. The court may then end that person\u2019s parental rights and obligations.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Emancipation of Minors:</b>\u00a0A minor may petition the court for a declaration of emancipation if the minor is at least 14 years of age, willingly lives separately from parents, and managing his own personal financial affairs.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>Jurisdiction</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p><b>Starting a Dissolution Action in Marin County</b></p>\n\n\t<p>A dissolution action may be started in Marin County if one or both spouses have resided in this county for at least the last three (3) months and in the state of California for at least six (6) months.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Starting a Legal Separation or Nullity Action in Marin County</b></p>\n\n\t<p>In legal separation or nullity cases, one or both spouses need only be a resident of this county at the time the case is filed.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Additional Rules for Spouses Outside of California</b></p>\n\n\t<p>In addition to the residency requirements for starting any termination of marriage action, there are some additional rules to consider if your spouse resides outside of California. Specifically, a spouse who lives in another state or country can object to jurisdiction by the court in California.

Parents usually feel better about these arrangements when they have input into the decision-making process. If they cannot agree about time sharing arrangements for minor children, the judicial officer presiding over the case will issue orders regarding the time sharing arrangements.</p>\n\n<p><b>Child custody and visitation CCR counseling is free</b>\u00a0and does not require the assistance of an attorney. It is intended to help parents through difficult changes in their family structure with dignity and support. The child custody recommending counselors, all skilled professionals in the mental health field, have a great deal of experience with children and can assist parents who need to make wise, but difficult, choices during stressful times.</p>\n\n<p>Family Court Services works with parents who have never married, who are in the process of divorcing, or who have separated some time ago but have reached a new turning point in their lives and need help making co-parenting decisions. Occasionally, Family Court Services works with grandparents and adoptive parents.</p>\n\n<p>Family Court Services' goal is always to empower both parents equally in order to reach decisions that both parents can support. When parents jointly reach decisions, their children maintain a sense that both are equally important and involved in their lives. This does not necessarily mean that children will spend exactly the same amount of time with each parent (it is often impossible or undesirable to divide time evenly), but it does mean that each parent should feel he or she has significant time with the child and makes an important contribution to the child's life. Children fare better in these stressful situations when they feel loved by both parents and are encouraged to love and respect each parent.</p>\n\n<h2>An Introduction to Family Court Services</h2>\n\n<p>Coming to Family Court Services for CCR counseling may seem frightening and confusing for parents and children. Please view the CCR Counseling Orientation materials below for answers to the most frequently asked questions about this process. Family Court Services is available to parties throughout the CCR counseling and resolution process.</p>\n\n<p>Even after custody and visitation agreements are reached by parents, sometimes circumstances change which require a modification to existing agreements. Family Court Services is available to help parents resolve disputes in these situations as well, until all minor children are 18 years of age.</p>\n\n<h2>Child Custody Recommending Counseling Orientation Online or In Print</h2>\n\n<p>Parties are strongly encouraged to learn about the process in Family Court Services. Family Court Services offers an Orientation presentation online. For more information, a booklet including a printed version of the slideshow is also available online.

More commonly, the Court awards \"joint\" legal custody of children to both parents so that both continue to be involved in important decisions affecting their children.</p>\n\n<p><b>Joint legal custody</b>\u00a0describes shared parental decisions over the child's health, education and welfare, but this does not mean that all decisions require parental concurrence on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sole physical custody</b>\u00a0is granted to one parent, but the Court almost always grants visitation rights to the other parent.</p>\n\n<p><b>Joint physical custody</b>\u00a0does not necessarily mean that the child spends equal time with each parent. In fact, an order for joint physical custody may specify that the child's primary residence will be with one parent.</p>\n\n<p><b>Please note:</b>\u00a0A joint custody court order does not necessarily mean that a child must split all of his or her time equally between parents. A parent's financial stability, relative to the other parent, is not a factor in determining the custody arrangements for the children. The Court's primary focus is on the child's needs, and thus on emotional -- not material -- factors. Accordingly, if a parent's financial resources are insufficient to provide proper care for the child, the remedy is a child support award, not denial of custody. In determining custody of minor children, California law requires the Court to make orders that serve the 'best interests of the child.' Accordingly, the Court seeks to achieve that standard in its custody and visitation orders.</p>\n\n<p>More Information on Child Custody Recommending Counseling.</p>\n\n<dl class=\"ckeditor-accordion\"><dt>How Child Custody Recommending Counseling Works</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>California law requires that parents who are unable to agree on a child-sharing plan must proceed to mandatory child custody recommending counseling (hereinafter \"CCR counseling\"). With the assistance of trained, professional child custody recommending counselors (hereinafter \"CCR counselors\"), parents will be given every opportunity to decide for themselves what will be in the best interests of their children. CCR counseling is generally more successful if parents understand the process and come prepared. Family Court Services encourages parents to seek guidance and support from their attorneys, therapists, family members and friends in developing a child-sharing proposal that meets the needs of both parents and children.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Initial Child Custody Recommending Counseling Session</b></p>\n\n\t<ul><li>Family Court Services will contact parents by letter to set an initial CCR counseling session;</li>\n\t\t<li>The goal of the initial CCR counseling session will be to develop a co-parenting agreement.\n\t\t<ul><li>If agreement is reached in CCR counseling, the CCR counselor will draft the agreement and both parents will sign it. Then, the judicial officer assigned to the case will sign the agreement, at which time it becomes a court order.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<p>If agreement is not reached in CCR counseling, the CCR counselor will make a recommendation to the Court for a co-parenting agreement. Parents will attend an Order to Show Cause (OSC) hearing, at which time the CCR counselor's recommendation will be considered by the judicial officer and parents will have an opportunity to state their objections to the recommendation.</p>\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t</ul></li>\n\t</ul><p><b>Request for Order Hearing</b></p>\n\n\t<ul><li>The judicial officer presiding over the case will issue a tentative ruling the day before the hearing based on the information presented by both parents and the CCR counselor's recommendations. <a href=\"/node/381\">Information on how to obtain tentative rulings is available by\u00a0clicking here</a>.\n\n\t\t<ul><li>If the parents\u00a0<b><i>agree</i></b>\u00a0with the judicial officer's tentative ruling, they do not need to appear at the Order to Show Cause hearing and the tentative ruling will become a permanent order of the court.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<p>If a parent\u00a0<b><i>disagrees</i></b>\u00a0with the judicial officer's tentative ruling, that parent must notify the other parent and the Court that they will appear at the hearing the next day.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>At the hearing, the judicial officer will hear what both parents have to say about the CCR counselor's recommendation.</p>\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t</ul></li>\n\t\t<li>The judicial officer may set a settlement conference or custody trial to address the areas of disagreement.

Even those children who do not directly witness the abuse are affected by the climate of violence in their homes and are likely to experience impaired development and socialization skills.</p>\n\n\t<p>Even very young children and infants are negatively affected by domestic violence. For these reasons, children - as well as adults - need to be protected from exposure to threats of violence or actual violence by a parent, caretaker, or other adults.\u00a0<b>Please be advised that mediators are required by law to report instances or suspicion of child abuse.</b></p>\n\n\t<p><b>Separate Child Custody Recommending Counseling in Cases in Which Domestic Violence is Alleged</b></p>\n\n\t<p>Where there has been a history of domestic violence or fear of potential violence, a parent has a right to request to meet separately with the child custody recommending counselor (hereinafter \"CCR counselor\"). These requests should be made in advance so that the CCR counselor is ready to accommodate them.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Support Person Present in Child Custody Recommending Counseling</b></p>\n\n\t<p>Where there has been a history of domestic violence or fear of potential violence, a parent has a right to bring a support person to the child custody recommending counseling (hereinafter \"CCR counseling\") session. The request to bring a support person must be made in advance. The support person must be willing to abide by the process of the counseling.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Exclusion of Support Person from Child Custody Recommending Counseling</b></p>\n\n\t<p>A child custody recommending counselor may exclude a support person from a CCR counseling session if:</p>\n\n\t<ul><li>The support person attempts to participate in the CCR counseling session;</li>\n\t\t<li>The support person acts as an advocate for the victim in a CCR counseling session;</li>\n\t\t<li>The support person's presence disrupts the process of the CCR counseling; or</li>\n\t\t<li>The support person's actions disrupt the CCR counseling session.</li>\n\t</ul><p><b>Other Safety Considerations</b></p>\n\n\t<p>A parent may request an escort off the premises of the courthouse following an appointment at Family Court Services.

Be businesslike. Be polite. Do not use bad language or name-calling. Do not try to conduct business under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. If you sense that you are becoming upset, say so, and agree to resume the conversation at a later time.</li>\n\t\t<li>Do not discuss any issues with the other parent in the presence of the children; limit your conversation when the children are exchanged to a simple \"hello\" and \"goodbye.\"</li>\n\t\t<li>Any phone calls about the children should be limited to only that topic; tell the other parent in advance whether you are calling to discuss the children or some other issue.</li>\n\t\t<li>Do not send messages for the other parent through your child. Talk to the other parent directly, by phone or by mail if necessary.</li>\n\t\t<li>Be very clear with each other about your plans for time with the children; include specific dates and times. Do not change any plans without first calling or discussing the proposed change with the other parent. Changes should be made by mutual agreement.</li>\n\t\t<li>To be sure each parent has the same information, follow up the discussion of any arrangement or agreement in writing, and send a copy to the other parent.</li>\n\t\t<li>Talk together to teachers, doctors, or other involved professionals to help resolve differences of opinion about what is best for your children.</li>\n\t\t<li>Each parent is responsible for the children's daily care when they are present. Certainly, it is important for parents to consult with each other regarding any changes in the child's educational and medical care, in advance of the change.</li>\n\t\t<li>Above all, cultivate goodwill in the partnership of raising your children. Keep in mind the importance of your investment and the expected returns. The investment is what you are willing to do for your children's happiness and success in life. The returns are comfort and security for your children, and the knowledge that their parents care enough about them to make their lives free from conflict.</li>\n\t</ol></dd>\n</dl></div>\n          </div>\n  \n</div>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n  </div>\n\n</article>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockcard-elements-cards clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-card-elements-cards\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"flex view view-card-elements view-id-card_elements view-display-id-cards js-view-dom-id-945f81f0335f761ffd4380e5ee24d9f587d3b9167ca6e7b1b7d0684cddaa6cd5\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blocktiles-element-tiles clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-tiles-element-tiles\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"view view-tiles-element view-id-tiles_element view-display-id-tiles js-view-dom-id-f38ab5b37d378e3a48f62e8b64d25dabba863025db8dd42e584fdd9fcea7d608\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4 pad5\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n\n  </div>\n\n        \t\t\t\t</div>", "parent": null},

This means that jurors are not on-call for an entire week, which was the system in all California counties just a few years ago. Now, jurors are summoned for a \"date certain\", and if they are not needed, they are released until summoned again. In some rare instances, jurors' dates may be changed, or continued, after they receive their summons. The Court believes that one-day, one-trial is a superior alternative to the old system, as it is less burdensome on jurors. The Court is very appreciative of the participation of summoned jurors in ensuring that a sufficient number of jurors are available to ensure fair and impartial jury trials.</p>\n\n<p>The Court receives regular updates to its master list of Marin County residents eligible to perform jury service. These updates come from the Department of Motor Vehicles, the Marin County Registrar of Voters and the list of resident state tax filers from the Franchise Tax Board. Tens of thousands of juror names are provided by each agency. The Court randomly selects a subset of jurors from the master list and sends jury summons notices to those prospective jurors.

The Jury Services area is also equipped with wireless internet capability, so you may bring a laptop to help you pass the time.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>How long does a trial take? How long will I be there?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>Trials may last one day to several weeks, but most trials end in less than a week. When you go to the courtroom, the judicial officer will advise you how long the trial is likely to take. You will have a chance to advise the judicial officer at that time if the trial length will be a hardship for you.<br>\n\tA typical Court day is from approximately 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>How often may I be called to serve?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>You may be summoned every year, unless you actually reported to the courthouse in response to a jury summons; in this case you will not be called for two years. Occasionally, you may receive a second summons prior to that time. Since the Court creates its master jury lists from lists provided by the Department of Motor Vehicles and Marin County Registrar or Voters, if your name is not identical in those two systems, the Court may have your name in its system more than once. If you receive a summons earlier than expected, notify Jury Services so we may correct the error and update our records.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>How long will I be required to serve?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>The Court observes the one-day, one-trial system for jury service. This means that if you are not called in on your selected date or continued to a new date, you have fulfilled your service requirements for one year. If you are required to appear at the courthouse in response to a jury summons and are not selected to serve on a sworn jury panel, you have fulfilled your service requirement for two years.

The Court calculates jurors' mileage based on residence zip code.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>I served jury duty and I have questions about my juror pay.</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>Please recall that jurors do not receive pay for their first day of jury duty. If you served more than one day and we have not yet paid you for your jury duty, please allow 20 business days for your payment to be processed. If after that time you have not received payment, you may email Jury Services or call us during telephone customer service hours of 1-3 p.m.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>Can I lose my job appearing for jury duty?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>Labor Code section 230 states that no employer shall discharge or in any manner discriminate against an employee for taking time off as required by law for jury service if such employee, prior to taking such time off, gives reasonable notice to the employer that he or she is required to serve. The Court advises qualified jurors to notify their employers upon receipt of a summons.</p>\n\t</dd>\n\t<dt>Will I have to go through court security screening to perform jury duty?</dt>\n\t<dd>\n\t<p>Yes, you will be required to go through screening if you are sent to a courtroom.

Once your dissolution of marriage is finalized, you go back to single status and you are able to remarry.</p>\n\n<p>California is a \"no fault\" divorce state, which means that the spouse or domestic partner that is asking for the divorce does not have to prove that the other spouse or domestic partner did something wrong. To get a no fault divorce, the spouse or domestic partner has to state that the couple cannot get along. Legally, this is called \"irreconcilable differences\".

This is a mandatory waiting period required by California law. There are many forms to fill out during the divorce process, and it can become complicated.

You cannot marry or enter into a partnership with someone else if you are legally separated (and not divorced). If you ask for a legal separation, you may be able to change to a divorce case later if you meet certain requirements.</p>\n\n\t<p>Like a divorce, you can address the following issues:</p>\n\n\t<ul><li>Child custody and visitation</li>\n\t\t<li>Child support</li>\n\t\t<li>Spousal or partner support</li>\n\t\t<li>Division of property and debts</li>\n\t\t<li>Attorney's fees</li>\n\t</ul><p>To get a legal separation, you follow the same basic process used for a divorce.

The purposes of the detention hearing are for the judicial officer to:\n\n\t\t<ul><li>Decide whether your child can go home before the next hearing,</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Appoint an attorney for your child if you cannot afford one, and</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Read the petition containing the charges against your child into the court record.</li>\n\t\t</ul></li>\n\t</ul><p>If your child was arrested, but was not detained in Juvenile Hall, you will receive notice of an arraignment hearing in the mail.</p>\n\n\t<ul><li><b>Pre-Trial Hearing:</b>\u00a0A pre-trial hearing will occur the day before trial to allow the parties in the matter to either resolve the case or to advise the Court that they are ready to proceed to trial.</li>\n\t\t<li><b>Jurisdiction Hearing:</b>\u00a0At the jurisdiction hearing, the judicial officer will decide whether or not your child committed the offense.</li>\n\t\t<li><b>Disposition Hearing:</b>\u00a0A disposition hearing is similar to a sentencing hearing in adult court. If the judicial officer finds that your child committed the offense, then at the disposition hearing the judicial officer will make orders that you and your child must abide by to resolve your child's delinquency case. Sometimes the disposition hearing is held right after the jurisdiction hearing, on the same day. Otherwise, it is held ten (10) court business days after the jurisdiction hearing.</li>\n\t</ul><p>In addition to the above hearings, you and your child may be required to attend any of the following hearings:</p>\n\n\t<ul><li><b>Early Resolution Hearing:</b>\u00a0A court appearance is scheduled to try to resolve the matter prior to trial.</li>\n\t\t<li><b>Hearings on Motions:</b>\u00a0There may be court appearances for the Court to hear additional issues that come up before the underlying case is resolved.</li>\n\t\t<li><b>Fitness Hearing:</b>\u00a0If your child is at least 14 years old and is charged with committing certain serious crimes, the District Attorney may ask the Juvenile Court to make a decision on whether your child should be tried as an adult. At the fitness hearing, the judicial officer will decide whether your child will be tried in adult court or in juvenile court. (Note: Effective March 2000, a law was enacted giving the District Attorney authority in some instances to directly file complaints in adult court against minors 14 years of age and older who commit certain serious crimes.)</li>\n\t\t<li><b>Review Hearings:</b>\u00a0In some cases, the law or the Court may set hearings to review your child's progress and performance under supervision provided by the Probation Department, Juvenile Services Division.</li>\n\t\t<li><b>Restitution Hearing:</b>\u00a0If the Court so orders, you and your child may have to pay restitution to the victim. Restitution is money to compensate the victim for losses caused by your child's unlawful conduct. Examples of restitution might include the value of stolen or damaged property, medical expenses, and lost wages.</li>\n\t</ul></dd>\n\t<dt>My child got a traffic citation.

The court may also order the minor to perform community service work; attend programs geared to assist minors in making better life choices; or complete other activities that the court determines will instruct minors on leading law-abiding lives. Serious offenses or safety risks generally results in detention at Juvenile Hall, possible placement out of the home, and potential longer term secure settings.</p>\n\n<p>The court must balance the interests of public safety and protection, the importance of victim restitution, and the best interests of the minor when deciding what conditions of probation to impose and where to place the minor if removal from the home is necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Juvenile Court jurisdiction over these proceedings is described in <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes.xhtml\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Welfare and Institutions Code Section 602</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/juvenile-justice\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a></strong> for information about how Juvenile Justice Court works.</p>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n</div>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n  </div>\n\n</article>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockcard-elements-cards clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-card-elements-cards\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"flex view view-card-elements view-id-card_elements view-display-id-cards js-view-dom-id-f9167ada14d0846e883575efd6d095e93965480fe77c55035e02595743c026f0\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blocktiles-element-tiles clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-tiles-element-tiles\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"view view-tiles-element view-id-tiles_element view-display-id-tiles js-view-dom-id-105fc3257ecae4c88cfbc29aa68f73ebcc97dc6d421af2c681ed8b39c69b4c0e\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4 pad5\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n\n  </div>\n\n        \t\t\t\t</div>", "parent": null},

Dependency matters are filed with the court when there are reports that children have been abandoned, abused or neglected by their parent(s) or legal guardian. These cases are also filed with the Court when parents or legal guardians are unable or unwilling to care for their children. For more <a href=\"/sites/default/files/marin/juvenile/jv050.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">information about parents' rights in Dependency Court, please\u00a0click here.</a></p>\n\n<p>While the desired outcome of these cases is to reunite children with their families or caregivers, if the court determines that this is not possible, the children may be temporarily placed in foster care or a guardian may be appointed by the court. Ultimately, if the court determines that the children cannot be reunited with their families, the parents' or legal guardian's rights to the children may be terminated and the children may become eligible for permanent adoption.</p>\n\n<p>Other agencies typically involved in dependency proceedings include the Marin County Department of Health and Human Services, Children and Family Services; Marin County Counsel; and private law firms. The court appoints legal counsel for most parties in Dependency Court.</p>\n\n<p>The objectives of Dependency Court are to:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Protect the health and safety of minor children;</li>\n\t<li>Preserve families, whenever possible;</li>\n\t<li>Provide placement of children with a relative, foster family, group home or an adoptive parent if it is determined to be in their best interest.</li>\n</ol><p>For more <a href=\"/sites/default/files/marin/juvenile/jv055.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">information about how Juvenile Dependency Court works, please\u00a0click here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n</div>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  \n  </div>\n\n</article>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blockcard-elements-cards clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-card-elements-cards\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"flex view view-card-elements view-id-card_elements view-display-id-cards js-view-dom-id-28a78544565ef9f17e84da45efd903cccc3b439b9ecc6281f02a858aa7b55a39\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"views-element-container block block-views block-views-blocktiles-element-tiles clearfix\" id=\"block-views-block-tiles-element-tiles\">\n\t<div class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"form-group\"><div class=\"view view-tiles-element view-id-tiles_element view-display-id-tiles js-view-dom-id-2c90a33761c5608fba469bd4b659bddf012ac72542f69a555ce977ef8e644b98\">\n  \n    \n      \n      <div class=\"view-content\">\n      <div class=\"flex\">\n  \n  \n    \n          <div class=\"col-md-4 pad5\">\n    </div>\n      \n</div>\n\n    </div>\n  \n          </div></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\n\n  </div>\n\n        \t\t\t\t</div>", "parent": null}
