County Superior Court or Law Enforcement staff advising recipients that they are in contempt of court for failure to appear, report, or respond and that these actions are a \"class E misdemeanor\". These people threaten arrests if fines are not paid. This is referred to as \"spoofing\" and occurs when an individual deliberately falsifies information to disguise their identity and is often used to attempt to trick someone into giving away valuable personal or financial information or to pay money. Some individuals have also reported that they have had people come to their homes representing themselves as court staff.   Although these calls and personal visits can be concerning, please be aware that court staff never calls or visits members of the public to advise them of a lawsuit against them, demand payment, or threaten arrest. The Court communicates by mail and correspondence will always include case information, future court dates, and fine information if applicable.   If you receive a personal visit, phone call or email from someone demanding payment for a court fine or warrant, you should immediately report it to your local law enforcement agency. If you have questions or concerns related to your case, please contact the clerk's office at (831) 775-5400 Monday through Friday 8:00 am to 4:00 pm. Additionally, please report any and all fraudulent behavior to the Federal Communications Commission and filing a claim. For information on Spoofing, visit the FCC's website to learn more.</p><!----><!----><!----><p><strong>Post date: </strong>September 27, 2018</p></div><hr></div><div><div><h4>ALERTA DE ESTAFA</h4><p>Se ha informado al Tribunal de que miembros de la comunidad han estado recibiendo llamadas telefonicas fraudulentas en las que se hacen pasar por personal del Tribunal Superior del Condado de Monterey o agentes de la policia, informando a los destinatarios de que estan en desacato ante el Tribunal por falta de comparecencia, asistencia o respuesta, y que estas acciones constituyen un \"Delito Menor de Clase E.\" Estas personas que llaman amenazan con arresto si no se pagan las multas. Estas llamadas se denominan \"fraudulentas\" y se dan cuando la persona que llama falsifica informacion deliberadamente para ocultar su identidad y, a menudo, se realizan a fin de intentar enganar a alguien para que brinde informacion personal o financiera valiosa o que pague dinero.   Aunque estas llamadas pueden ser preocupantes, por favor, tenga muy en cuenta que ni el personal del Tribunal ni la policia llaman por telefono a miembros de la comunidad para notificarles de una demanda en su contra, exigir un pago o amenazar con arrestarles. El Tribunal se comunica por correo y la correspondencia siempre incluye informacion del caso, fechas de proximas citas y datos sobre multas cuando corresponde.   Si recibe una llamada telefonica o un correo electronico de alguien que exige el pago de una multa u orden judicial, debe comunicarselo inmediatamente a la policia del condado. Si tiene preguntas o inquietudes relacionadas con su caso, por favor, comuniquese con la oficina administrativa llamando al (831) 775-5400 de lunes a viernes de 8:00 a.m. a 4:00 p.m.   Asimismo, haga el favor de informar de cualquier fraude a la Comision Federal de Comunicaciones haciendo clic aqui y presentando su reclamacion.

The committees meet with county, city and local agency officials, visit government facilities and conduct independent research on matters of interest or concern. <br><br> Generally, once or twice each month, the full jury will convene a plenary meeting at which each committee will report and provide updates on their research and investigative progress and findings. The full jury will discuss and study the issues and vote on how to proceed. All actions and investigations require a majority vote by the jury. <br><br> The Civil Grand Jury also has direct access to legal advice provided by the Monterey County Counsel, the Monterey County Superior Court Judge designated by the Presiding Judge as the Civil Grand Jury Legal Advisor and the Monterey County District Attorney. When warranted, the Civil Grand Jury may also seek advice from the Attorney General. </p><h4> COMPENSATION </h4><p> Jury members are paid $15 per day for attendance of regular Civil Grand Jury and committee meetings, along with reimbursement at the current Federal mileage rate for mileage to and from jury meetings and site visits. No additional compensation is provided. </p><h4> HISTORY </h4><p> The Civil Grand Jury is an investigatory body created for the protection of society and enforcement of the law. The concept of juries dates back to Norman times in the 800's. </p></div><!----><!----><!----><!----></div>", "parent": ""},

To notify the court of a need for an interpreter, please complete the <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/int300.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">Interpreter Request form</a> and submit it to any clerk at the public counter or via email to the Interpreter Coordinator <a href=\"mailto:InterpreterReporterCoordinator@monterey.courts.ca.gov\" taget=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">InterpreterReporterCoordinator@monterey.courts.ca.gov</a>. </p><p>The clerk will review the document for accuracy and return a received stamped copy back to the requester. The Interpreter Coordinator will make every effort to contact and schedule an interpreter for the language requested. Please make your request for an interpreter no later than 15-20 days before your scheduled hearing as some languages are in great demand and securing a certified and or registered interpreter on short notice can be difficult. If you submit your request on the day of your hearing, your matter may be continued to a later date to allow time for an interpreter to be contacted and scheduled. </p><p>The division provides interpreters for the courts, free of charge, in all mandated cases. To request an additional Spanish interpreter for an upcoming hearing, a minimum of 72 hour notice is needed for Spanish; and 15 - 10 days for languages other than Spanish, including American Sign Language. </p><p>The Court will seek to provide a state certified or state registered interpreter; however, due to a shortage of certified and or registered interpreters statewide, the court may provide a provisionally qualified interpreter (non-certified, non-registered). If no interpreter is available at the time of your hearing, your case may be continued.</p><p>If the hearing date or service for which an interpreter has been requested is cancelled or postponed, please cancel the interpreter request with the Courtroom Clerk or Interpreter Coordinator at the above email address, no less than 24 hours in advance of your hearing date.</p><p>A Spanish interpreter is regularly present in the courtroom and other designated courtrooms, as needed. If another language is needed inform the Judge at the time of your court hearing if not scheduled in advance and state the name of the language you speak.

Since the Court is prohibited from giving legal advice, you may wish to seek legal advice or contact the authority issuing the shelter in place order for guidance. </p><p> However, the Court always encourages parties to meet and confer in an attempt to resolve areas of potential dispute.

Some providers have decided they are unable to safely provide these services in this crisis. Others have determined they can safely provide services in their situation. Again, as in the preceding question, parties are encouraged to meet and confer if no order prevents that. Possible agreements include: </p><ul><li> Stipulating to a different professional provider.

Children are no exception: children must stay inside, are unable to go to school or day care, and cannot have contact with friends and extended family due to the \"shelter-in-place\" orders. </p><p> Children deserve to have consistency and stability during this difficult time. For that reason, we encourage parents to follow their existing parenting plan as closely as possible during this time. </p><p> Below, we give parents general guidelines to ensure that children have frequent and continuing contact with both parents, as is California policy. These guidelines are not meant as legal advice and do not apply to every situation. The health, safety and welfare of children is the primary goal of any parenting plan. </p><p> We urge you to work cooperatively to ensure the safety of your children! If you and your children's other parent cannot resolve your disagreements, the Family Court is available to decide child custody issues. </p><p><strong>General Guidelines for Your Parenting Plan:</strong></p><ol><li><strong style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">Communicate with Each Other</strong><p>Unless there are restraining orders that keep parents from communicating, parents should discuss how they are working to reduce the risk of the children being exposed to the COVID-19 virus. In general, a parent cannot deny the other parent their parenting time based on a subjective belief that the other parent is not protecting the children well enough.</p></li><li><strong style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">Do Not Deny the Other Parent Their Parenting Time</strong><p>COVID-19 is not a reason to deny parenting time. Parents are considered fit to care for their children and make the day-to-day parenting decisions, unless a court has decided differently. Day-to-day care includes following orders and recommendations by the State of California and Monterey County Health department, such as social distancing and frequent hand-washing.</p></li><li><strong style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">Treat Your Timesharing Plan the Same as if Your Children Were Attending School as Usual</strong><p>While schools are closed, court-ordered parenting time should continue as if the children are attending school in their regular school district. When interpreting the court-ordered timesharing plan, parents should not treat the school closure as the child's spring or summer break. It is also not treated as a \"weekend\" under the timesharing plan.</p></li><li><strong style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">Make Changes to Your Parenting Time Exchanges if Needed</strong><p>During the exchange of children, parties should follow public health directives for limiting the spread of the COVID-19 virus. This may mean choosing a different location with fewer people or fewer risks of contamination from objects or surfaces. (Example: moving the exchange from inside a store or restaurant to the parking lot)</p></li><li><strong style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">You May Need to Change the Parenting Time in Public Places</strong><p>If the parenting time is supposed to take place in a public place that is now closed, such as a park, the parents should try to agree to a different and safe location. If that is not possible, the parenting time should instead take place by video or telephone.</p></li><li><strong style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">Make Changes, if Needed, to Your Supervised Visitation</strong><p>If a parent is ordered to have supervised visitation with a child, and the supervisor is unavailable due to COVID-19 related issues, the parents should work together to make sure that a safe visit can happen. For example, the parents could agree to having a different supervisor for the visits, or allow the visit to take place by video or telephone. For more information about supervised visitation, see the frequently asked questions under the Family tab on the court's website.</p></li><li><strong style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">Travel</strong><p>Parents who are able to drive the children to the other parent's home or exchange location should continue to do so. Travel that requires the use of public transportation, including air travel, may require appropriate precautions in order to avoid exposing the child to unnecessary risk. Parents should communicate about necessary precautions.</p></li><li><strong style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">Options When One Parent Does Not Follow the Court Orders</strong><p>If you need to change the existing parenting plan because you and the other parent cannot agree on needed changes, the Family Court offers hearings and child custody mediation by telephone or video. If you have evidence that there is an immediate threat to a child's health or safety, you may ask the court for emergency orders.</p></li></ol><p> Our first responders (Sheriff, police, fire, EMTs) are providing much needed support for issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and must be available for true emergencies. So please do not call first responders regarding enforcement of child custody orders unless an immediate and significant safety issue is present. </p></div><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----></div>", "parent": ""},

This program was designed by judges in collaboration with the Office of Governor Gavin Newsom. The primary objective of the program is to identify, encourage, and provide mentors for all individuals considering a judicial career. Wherever possible, applicants will be paired with judicial mentors based upon shared backgrounds, professional experiences, and common interests. <br><br> Mentor judges will be available to those seeking guidance in applying to the bench and to those who have already applied. The role of the mentor judge is not to select or recommend candidates, rather it is to demystify the application and vetting process. Mentors and applicants will be expected to meet quarterly each year to set objectives, evaluate progress, and discuss future professional development goals. </div><br><div> The program is offered under the leadership of Monterey County Superior Court Presiding Judge Pamela L. Butler and the Judicial Mentor Committee comprising of Judge Rafael Vazquez, Judge Jennifer O'Keefe, Judge Mark E. Hood, and Judge Vanessa W. Vallarta. </div><br><div><strong> MISSION STATEMENT </strong><br> The Monterey County Superior Court Judicial Mentor Program is designed to promote public trust and confidence in the judicial system by ensuring a judiciary that reflects the unique communities in Monterey County and the State of California. Judges involved in the program will work to support and encourage all individuals interested in a judicial career. </div><br><div><strong> PROGRAM OBJECTIVES </strong><br> The Monterey County Superior Court Judicial Mentor Program is designed to assist in the recruitment of a qualified, inclusive, and diverse applicant pool; connect judicial mentors with all qualifying individuals interested in pursuing a judicial career; conduct educational outreach programs to provide information on the judicial application and appointment process and general criteria for appointment; and evaluate program success by capturing data to measure the overall effectiveness of the program. </div><br><div><strong> HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS </strong><br> This two-part program consists of a one-on-one mentor committee and a community outreach/recruitment committee. </div><br><div><strong> MENTOR COMMITTEE </strong><br> The Monterey County Superior Court judicial officers are committed to the important work of mentoring all individuals interested in a judicial career. To assist in the recruitment and development of an outstanding, inclusive, and diverse judicial applicant pool, the Court has appointed a formal panel of mentor judges who will be available to qualified individuals seeking guidance in applying to the bench. Participants will be paired with a mentor judge who will discuss the prospective applicant's career objectives, answer questions regarding the application and vetting process, and be available to assist in providing input as the candidate completes the application and progresses through the judicial appointment process. </div><br><div><strong> OUTREACH COMMITTEE </strong><br> The Outreach Committee will work with all sectors of the legal community, including bar associations, public interest organizations, government attorneys, private law firms, and solo practitioners. <br><br> The goals of the outreach effort are to inform members of the legal community of the program, disseminate consistent information regarding the Governor's judicial criteria, and identify and encourage leaders within all sectors of the legal community to assist in recruiting candidates interested in a judicial career. <br><br> The Outreach Committee will work with all sectors of the local legal community to formalize a recruitment process that results in one-on-one mentoring with judges. </div><br><div><strong> APPLICANT REQUIREMENTS </strong><br> An applicant must have practiced law in the State of California for at least 10 years, be in good standing with the State Bar of California, and be able to commit to meeting with an assigned mentor at least four times a year. </div><br><div><strong> HOW TO APPLY </strong><br> Interested individuals should click on the <a href=\"https://mscpublicwebsiteprd.blob.core.windows.net/publicwebsiteprd/Misc/judicialMentorshipApplication.pdf\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">link</a> to view or download the fillable Judicial Mentor Program Application and submit their completed Application and Resume to <a href=\"mailto:judicialmentorprogram@monterey.courts.ca.gov\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">judicialmentorprogram@monterey.courts.ca.gov</a><br> Participation in the Monterey County Superior Court Judicial Mentor Program does not guarantee appointment of any applicant to the bench. </div></div><div class=\"col-lg-2\"><div role=\"group\" aria-label=\"Vertical button group\" class=\"btn-group-vertical\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mscpublicwebsiteprd.blob.core.windows.net/publicwebsiteprd/Misc/FAQ%20California%20Judicial%20Mentor%20Program.pdf\" class=\"btn btn-warning custom-btn bottom-border\">Judicial Mentor Program FAQs</a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mscpublicwebsiteprd.blob.core.windows.net/publicwebsiteprd/Misc/judicialMentorshipApplication.pdf\" class=\"btn btn-warning custom-btn bottom-border\">Judicial Mentor Application Form</a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/instructions-for-completing-judicial-appointment-applications/\" class=\"btn btn-warning custom-btn bottom-border\">Instructions for Completing Judicial Appointment Application</a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8wgn5rB-pc&amp;t=650s\" class=\"btn btn-warning custom-btn bottom-border\">Video: New Judicial Appointment Secretary</a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/07/01/governor-newsom-launches-california-judicial-mentor-program-to-promote-a-diverse-and-inclusive-judiciary/\" class=\"btn btn-warning custom-btn bottom-border\">Governors Press Release Re: Judicial Mentorship Program</a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.calbar.ca.gov/About-Us/Who-We-Are/Committees/Judicial-Nominees-Evaluation\" class=\"btn btn-warning custom-btn\">Judicial Nominees Evaluation</a></div></div></div>", "parent": ""},

It is the policy of the courts of California to ensure that people with disabilities have equal and full access to the judicial system. Under this rule, any person who has a physical or mental impairment that limits one or more major life activities, has a record of such impairment, or is regarded as having such impairment may request an accommodation. According to the rule, access can mean physical accommodation to enter and move about buildings and use accessible restrooms. Access can also mean full participation in the court's programs, services, and activities, with the assistance of technology or other services. To provide both kinds of access, courts in California are responsible for providing reasonable accommodations to court users. </p><p> Accommodations can be provided in a variety of ways. Because people and disabilities are unique, the courts and persons with disabilities must interactively discuss each person's needs and the effective accommodations that the court can provide. </p><p><b> Requests for ADA accommodations: </b></p><p> Please contact the Court's ADA Coordinator at 831-775-5400 extension 3013 and submit Judicial Council Form MC\u2013410. </p><p><b> Wheelchair Access </b></p><p> Exterior ADA ramps are available at the each Court location. </p><p><b> Hearing Impairments </b></p><p> Each courtroom is equipped with a Phonic Ear\u00ae Personal FM System. The wireless receivers will allow a person to sit anywhere in the courtroom and hear the proceedings. These listening devices are useful whether or not you already have a hearing aid. Should you wish to use this assistive listening device, please ask the court attendant or bailiff. </p><p><b> Parking </b></p><p> All public parking lots and structures adjacent to court facilities have ADA accessible parking spaces. Below is a map of the Salinas Court Complex parking areas and ADA access ramps. </p><p><b> Visual Impairments </b></p><p> For free tools that allow persons with visual disabilities to read documents in Adobe Acrobat PDF format, please visit <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/accessibility.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\"> https://www.adobe.com/accessibility.html </a>.

A reporter's transcript is only available if a court reporter was present during the trial court proceedings and made a record of what was said in those proceedings. The court reporter is responsible for preparing transcripts of hearings as required by law or upon request. Requirements for the format of transcripts are set forth in <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=eight&amp;linkid=rule8_144\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">California Rule of Court 8.144</a>. </p><p>Transcripts are the property of the court reporter.</p><p><strong>How much will my transcript cost?</strong></p><p>Once the court reporter contacts you, they will tell you the cost of the transcript prescribed by law. The rates that reporters may charge for transcripts, as well as other information about reporter transcripts, are contained in the <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&amp;division=&amp;title=8.&amp;part=&amp;chapter=5.&amp;article=9.\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">Government Code, starting at section 69950</a>.

There are limited funds available for fee waivers under the program. </p><p><strong>What if I need my transcript ASAP?</strong></p><p>If your request is urgent, please comment \"RUSH\" in the additional comment box on the online form. It usually takes a few days to process a request, but the reporters may expedite rush requests. There may be an additional fee for expedited transcript requests; if so, the court reporter will tell you when he or she contacts you. </p><p> In some cases, it may not be possible for a court reporter to provide a transcript on a rush basis, but every effort will be made to meet the request. </p><p><strong>How far back in time can I request a transcript? </strong></p><p> According to state law <a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&amp;division=&amp;title=8.&amp;part=&amp;chapter=1.4.&amp;article=\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">Government Code Section 68152</a> the court reporters' notes for criminal cases are destroyed after ten years, and notes for civil cases are destroyed after five years.

New evidence is not accepted on appeal. The Appellate Court's decision addresses the evidence offered and decisions made at the time of the trial.

Proof of Service must be filed with the Court at least two (2) days before the Court Trial. </li></ol><p> If the party defendant(s) is/are in the State of California, the Court Clerk can serve the claim by certified mail. The additional certified mail fee with pre-addressed envelopes to the defendant(s) must accompany the original claim form and copies. </p><p> Before a case can be heard in Small Claims Court, each defendant (or plaintiff if you are the defendant filing a claim) must receive a copy of the filed claim. This is called \"service of process\" or \"service\". The defendant must be served within the State of California. There are two exceptions to the service within the State of California rule. If either of these exceptions apply, contact the Small Claims Advisor for instructions on how to serve the claim: </p><ol><li> If the claim involves real property owned by a defendant who lives outside the state of California; or </li><li> If the claim arose from a car accident where the owner or operator of the motor vehicle involved in an accident is an out of state resident. </li></ol><p> The defendant must be served within explicit time limits. The defendant must be served at least 15 days before the trial date if the defendant is located in Monterey County, or at least 20 days before the trial date if the defendant is located outside of Monterey County. </p><p><b> You may NOT serve the claim yourself. The Defendant can be served in one of the following ways: </b></p><ol><li><b> By Certified Mail: </b><br> Only the Small Claims Clerk can serve the claim this way. There is an additional fee for each defendant you wish to have served, and you must provide an addressed envelope for each defendant. Service is completed when the receipt, signed by the Defendant, is returned to the Clerk. If the Defendant refuses to sign, service is not considered complete. The Postal Service cannot force the Defendant to sign for the letter. </li><li><b> By Personal Service: </b><br> Any person who is 18 years old or older, and who is NOT a party to the claim, can serve the claim. A witness is generally considered a party to the claim. </li><li><b> By Substituted Service: </b><br> If you can't find the party you must serve at his or her home or place of business, you can use substituted service to serve the claim. Substituted service must be performed by the sheriff or by someone who is at least 18 years old and who is not a party to the case. <br><br> Substituted service is accomplished by leaving a copy of the claim at the defendant's office with a person who appears to be in charge, or at his home with someone who is at least 18 years old. The person who is given the claim must be told what it is. <br><br> A copy of the claim must be mailed by first class mail to the defendant at the address where the claim was left. The copy of the claim must be mailed to the defendant at least 20 days before the hearing if the defendant resides in Monterey County, or 25 days before the hearing if the defendant resides outside of the county, in order for the substituted service to be complete. <br> The claim is considered served 10 days after the copy is mailed. <br><br> Proof of service must be filed with the small claims court clerk. </li><li><b> By a registered Process Server: </b><br> They are listed in the consumer yellow pages of you telephone book </li><li><b> By a Sheriff: </b><br> To obtain instructions from the Monterey County Sheriff's office please call (831) 755-3712. </li></ol><p> The person who serves the Defendant must file a proof of service form with the Small Claims Clerk before the trial.

In the Monterey County Court, the proof of service must be filed at least 2 days before the trial. </p><p> The Defendant need not accept or touch the claim in order to be served. Once the Defendant has been correctly identified, the claim can be dropped at his or her feet. </p><p><b> Who to Serve </b></p><p> A copy of the claim must be delivered to each person or business being sued. This is called serving the defendant or defendants. </p><p><b>If you are suing an individual</b>, serve the person you are suing.

Otherwise, service is not considered complete and the trial will not proceed. If a process server serves the claim, the server will usually file the proof of service. </p><p><b> How to Locate a Person or Business </b></p><p><b> Locating a Person: </b></p><p> If you are having trouble finding the person you wanted to sue or who owes you money, you may find the following information helpful in locating them. </p><p> If the person has moved, address a letter to him at his or her last known address. Several spaces below your return address write, \"Address Correction Requested. Do Not Forward\". The letter will be returned to you with the new address, if one is on file. </p><p> If the person you are seeking owns property, try the Monterey County Clerk/Recorder's Office.

A Court Commissioner or a Judge pro tempore (temporary judge) will hear your case. A judge pro tempore is a California licensed attorney who volunteers his or her time to hear and decide cases. Both the commissioner and the pro tem judge have all the responsibilities and powers of a judge. </p><p> The Commissioner or judge pro tempore may ask that the parties try mediation before the case is heard. Mediators from the Mandell Gisnet Center will offer mediation services free of charge. </p><p><b>When your name is called</b>, you and the other party in your case will move to the front of the room and tell your stories to the judge. Small claims cases usually take no more than 5 to 10 minutes. Therefore, it is very important that you plan ahead of time what you will say. Your story should be well organized and to the point. Do not go off on tangents, include too many details or be repetitious. Stay calm and polite </p><p><b>If you are the person suing (the Plaintiff), you will speak first</b>. Although everyone swears to tell the truth under penalty of perjury, don't count on the other party admitting fault. It is up to you to PROVE your case. </p><p><b>Telling a story in court is not like telling it to a friend</b>. When you talk to a friend, you often start at the beginning, build up some suspense and finish with a punch line. In court you do the opposite. You want the judge to know as soon as possible why you are there. Your Opening Statement should summarize the nature of your claim and the damages you have suffered as a result of injury, breach of contract, violation of a right, etc. For example: why the other person is at fault through intentional or negligent behavior and why you did not contribute substantially to the loss. </p><p> In a case of breach of contract you might say, \"Your honor, this is a matter of a painter who did not carry out his contract to paint my house in Monterey after I paid him the full amount of $2,500 on February 1, 2018\". Or, in a landlord tenant dispute, \"Your Honor, this is a case of a security deposit of $600 which has not been returned to me although I moved out on January 1, 2018 with proper notice and left the place clean and with no damage\". </p><p><b>Briefly give the facts, usually in chronological order</b>. Group facts together. Instead of reciting all the dates you brought your car back for repairs, say \"In the 6 months between January and June of 2018, I took the car in 14 times and each time he did not adjust the carburetor.\" </p><p><b>Decide what the main points and issues are and stick to those in telling your story, referring to evidence that supports your position</b>. Evidence can include copies of contracts, estimates (you should have at least 2 for car repair and similar disputes), bills, photographs, diagrams (important for auto accidents), police reports, etc. If you need documents that are not in your possession, you can request them through a Subpoena Duces Tecum. This is a form you get from the Clerk, which you serve on the party who has the documents. Be selective. You don't want to overwhelm the judge with either the number or complexity of your materials. </p><p><b>You may also bring witnesses. Your witness(es) can be</b> either someone who has first-hand knowledge of the facts (he/she saw the accident) or is an expert on the subject (the mechanic who examined your car after it was towed). Avoid bringing friends or relatives (the judge may think they are only trying to help you) and be sure you know what to expect from your witnesses. It is not a good idea to subpoena a \"hostile\" witness; your defendant's girlfriend who saw him hit you, may surprise you with her testimony; or the mechanic who is worried about his job may change his story in court. </p><p><b>In planning what to say</b>, try to anticipate and be prepared to refute what the other party will bring up. In addition to explaining how the other party was at fault, you should be able to show how your own behavior was not also responsible, that you tried to minimize the loss or, if you are the defendant, that the person suing you did not do his/her best to reduce the extent of his/her loss. Example: \"When I broke my lease by moving out 3 months early, the landlord did not even try to rent the apartment to anyone else\". </p><p><b>If you cannot express yourself in English, you should bring someone who can</b>. The court does not provide an interpreter and you will want to be sure the judge fully understands your story. <b>If you bring a friend or relative to interpret, they must interpret your words, not tell the story for you</b>. If you know you will be very nervous and likely to leave out important facts, briefly summarize your case in writing and ask the judge to allow you to submit it before you tell your story. Be sure to have a copy for the other side. </p><p><b>You can refer to any specific laws that relate to your case</b> and may even present information you have received from a consultation with an attorney. Remember though, that you are not supposed to be a lawyer and it is not necessary to act like one. </p><h4> How to Prepare and Present the Case </h4><p> If you believe the party suing you owes you money you can countersue by filing Judicial Council form \"Defendant's Claim and Order to Plaintiff\" (<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc120.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">Judicial Council Form SC-120</a>). Both cases will be heard at the same time. </p><p> If your claim is for $7500 or less ($2,500 or less if you are suing a guarantor) obtain a \"Defendant's Claim\" form from the Small Claims Clerk in the court where you are being sued or <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm?filter=SC\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">see SMALL CLAIMS FORMS</a>. The claim must be filed with the Clerk together with the respective filing fee. See <a class=\"anchor-tag-inline\" href=\"/bail-fee-schedules\">Court fee schedule</a>.</p><p> You must notify the other party that you are suing by having a copy of the Claim of Defendant served on them at least 5 days before the trial date. However, if you were served with the Plaintiff's claim ten (10) days or less before the trial date, you can serve the defendant's claim at least one day before the trial date. You cannot serve the Claim of Defendant yourself.</p><p> If your counter claim exceeds the jurisdictional limit of the Small Claims Court and you want your case to be heard in the Civil Division of the Superior Court, you must first file a Summons and Complaint in that Division. You will need to bring to the Small Claims Clerk a copy of the Civil Complaint, a copy of the Proof of Service, a Declaration, a Request and Order for Consolidation along with the appropriate transfer fee. The Request and Order will be submitted to the Commissioner for approval.</p><p> Upon receipt of the above described documents, the Small Claims Court will transfer its file to the Superior Court. In this manner, both the plaintiff's and defendant's claims may be heard together.</p><h4> How to Appeal a Judgment </h4><p>An appeal of a Small Claims Court judgment is a request to the Superior Court to reverse the decision of the Small Claims Court by having the case heard again. A Plaintiff does not have the right to appeal a small claims judgment except in certain circumstances. </p><p> The rule to remember is if you lose on your own claim, you cannot appeal, but if you lose on the other party's claim, you can appeal. It is especially important to remember this when a claim of defendant is filed. In that case, the original Defendant is acting as Plaintiff and cannot appeal if he or she loses on the claim of defendant.</p><p> An insurer of the defendant may also appeal the judgment if the judgment exceeds $2500 and its policy with the Defendant covers the matter to which the judgment applies.</p><p> An appeal of the small claims judgment must be filed within 30 calendar days of the date of the Small Claims decision or, if the decision is mailed to you, within 30 days of the date the clerk mails the Notice of Entry of judgment. The date will appear on the form you receive.</p><p> To file the appeal, get a <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc140.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">\"Notice of Filing Notice of Appeal\" (Judicial Council Form SC-140)</a> form from the Small Claims clerk. Fill it out and file it with the Small Claims clerk. Check the courts <a class=\"anchor-tag-inline\" href=\"/bail-fee-schedules\">fee schedule</a> for the most current fee.</p><p> The case is heard in Superior Court and is treated as a new case. All the evidence and witnesses must be presented again.</p><p> On appeal, the claim is heard for the original amount. For example, if you were sued for $1,000 in Small Claims Court and the judgment against you was for $500, on an appeal the judge has the right to award the full $1,000 to the plaintiff if you lose.</p><p> While the case is being appealed, the defendant does not have to pay the Small Claims Court judgment.</p><p> If the Defendant loses the appeal, the Defendant must pay the Plaintiff the amount of the judgment plus interest and costs; examples of costs are any earnings you can prove you lost or any money you actually paid for transportation and lodging in connection with the appeal. The Defendant may also have to pay attorney's fees up to $150.00.</p><p> If the court finds that the appeal was intended to harass or delay the Plaintiff, or to encourage the Plaintiff to abandon the claim, the court may award the plaintiff attorney fees of up to $1,000.00 and any actual lost earnings. The court may, if it wishes, award the cost of lodging and transportation incurred in connection with the appeal up to $1,000.00, following a hearing on the matter.</p><h4> How to Change a Hearing Date or Claim </h4><p><b> If the claim has been served on all Defendants </b></p><p> A continuance is a request to postpone a court date. If the defendant(s) have been served you may use the <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc150.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">Application for Postponement of Trial Date (Judicial Council Form SC-150)</a> . Once the application is received, with the appropriate fee, it will be submitted to the judge. Only the judge may grant the continuance request.</p><p> The application must be mailed or brought in, to the Small Claims Clerk's office at least 10 days before the scheduled hearing date. A check made payable to the court must also be included. If the application is granted, the hearing will be postponed for at least 15 days. Notice of the new date will be mailed to all parties.</p><p> If you do not have enough time before your hearing date to write to ask for a continuance, you should either appear in court as scheduled and ask for a continuance, or bring a written statement explaining why you need a new court date to the Small Claims Clerk's office and ask to have it attached to your case file. There is a fee for this service.</p><p><b> Postponing the Court Trial </b></p><ol><li> If settlement negotiations are pending or for some reason a party is not available to attend the Court Trial on the date the case is set for trial, that party can ask the court to postpone the Court Trial. </li><li> If the Court has not granted a continuance of the Court Trial date and a party does not appear for the Court Trial, the court may enter a judgment in favor of the other party. </li></ol><p><b> If you have been unable to serve all or some of the Defendants </b></p><p> Contact the Small Claims clerk for instructions. </p><p><b> How to Change or Amend a Claim </b></p><p> You can change or amend a party name before hearing on a claim that has already been filed in Small Claims Court in the following ways:</p><p> If your claim has not been served, file and serve an \"amended\" claim to correct the parties' names (<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc100.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">Judicial Council Form SC-100</a> or <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc120.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">SC-120</a>) or dismiss (without prejudice) your claim and start over by filing a new claim, as long as the statute of limitations on your claim has not run out. A new filing fee will be charged.</p><p> If your claim has been served, complete the Judicial Council form REQUEST TO AMEND CLAIM BEFORE HEARING <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc114.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">(Judicial Council Form SC-114)</a>, a copy of this request must be mailed or personally delivered to each of the other parties in the case. A decision on your request to amend your claim will be made at the hearing. The judge or commissioner can grant or deny your request or continue the hearing.</p><p> To delete one or more Defendants: Use the dismissal form you received with your claim. Be sure to indicate that you are dismissing the case only against one or more defendant (you will list each defendant's name that you want dismissed from the case). You do not have to notify the remaining Defendants of the dismissal. </p><h4> How to Collect a Judgment </h4><p> You will have to collect your money yourself if you win in Small Claims Court. The court will not collect it for you. You must wait at least 30 days before attempting to collect. The 30 days starts from the date of the decision (if the defendant appeared in court) or the mailing date of the Notice of Entry of Judgment if you have a Default Judgment or the decision was mailed to you. You will need to check with the county Sheriff in the appropriate county to see if they serve Writs of Execution. If not, you will need to employ a process server who will serve the writ. If the 30th day falls on a weekend or holiday, they have one additional \"workday\" to file their appeal. The judgment is good for 10 years and can be renewed. You are entitled to interest, at 10 percent per annum, beginning with the date of the Entry of judgment, and payment for some of your costs in collecting the judgment. </p><p> To add your costs to the judgment, ask the Clerk in the Small Claims Office for a Memorandum of Costs and Credits form. Fill it out and return it to the clerk. After you collect your judgment, you must file a Satisfaction of Judgment form with the Clerk. </p><p> The following are some things you can do to try to collect if the person who owes you money, called the judgment debtor, refuses to pay: </p><ol><li> Garnish the Debtor's Wages: A wage garnishment orders the debtor's employer to give you part of the debtor's wages until the debt is paid. To garnish wages, complete a Writ of Execution form (<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej130.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">Judicial Council Form EJ-130</a>) and bring it to the Small Claims Clerk to issue. <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm?filter=SC\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">See SMALL CLAIMS FORMS</a> for the link to the Judicial Council web site. The \"Writ\" must then be delivered to the Monterey County Sheriff or a process server for service. There is a fee for the clerk to issue the \"Writ\" and an additional fee charged by the Sheriff or process server. </li><li> Levy upon the Debtor's Bank Account: This means that money will be taken from the debtor's bank account to pay the judgment. You will need the name, address and branch of the bank. <br> To levy a bank account, complete a Writ of Execution form (<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej130.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">Judicial Council Form EJ-130</a>) and bring it to the Small Claims Clerk to issue. <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm?filter=SC\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">See SMALL CLAIMS FORMS</a> for the link to the Judicial Council web site. The \"Writ\" must then be delivered to the Monterey County Sheriff or a process server for service. There is a fee for the clerk to issue the \"Writ\" and an additional fee charged by the Sheriff or process server. </li><li> Record an Abstract of Judgment: An \"Abstract of Judgment\" puts a lien on any land, house or other buildings the debtor owns in the county where the abstract is recorded. Record the abstract in all counties where the debtor may own property. If the property is sold, the debt will be paid out of the proceeds of the sale. <br><br> An Abstract of Judgment will also put a lien on property the debtor may buy in the future and prevent the debtor from refinancing any property until the debt is paid. <br><br> To record an Abstract of judgment, complete an Abstract of Judgment form and bring it to the Small Claims Clerk to issue. There is a fee. See <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\"> SMALL CLAIMS FORMS</a>. Take the \"Abstract\" to the County Recorder's office to record. There is an additional fee at the Recorder's office. <br><br> The Monterey County Clerk/Recorder's office is located at 240 Church Street, West Wing, Salinas, CA. </li></ol><p><b> There are also some other ways to try and collect judgments: </b></p><ol><li> Hold a Judgment Debtor Hearing: A judgment debtor hearing requires the debtor to come to court and answer your questions about his salary, bank accounts, property and anything else that could be used to pay the judgment. If you wish, you can subpoena bank books, property deeds, paycheck stubs, etc., before you hold the hearing. You will need a Subpoena Duces Tecum. You can pick up the form from the Small Claims clerk. <br><br> To set a Hearing, complete the \"Order of Examination\" form (<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej125.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">EJ-125</a>). <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm?filter=SC\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">See SMALL CLAIMS FORMS</a> for the link to the Judicial Council web site. There is a fee. You will take the Order of Examination to the Monterey County Sheriff or a process server to have the judgment debtor served. The Sheriff or process server will also charge a fee. The debtor must be within 150 miles of the Court. </li><li> Suspend Debtor's Driver's License: If you won a judgment for $500 or less in an auto accident case, and the judgment is not paid within 90 days after the judgment becomes final, you can have the debtor's driver's license suspended for 90 days.

You must do this within 30 days from the date the Notice of Entry of Judgment was mailed from the court. You should have a good reason for not having appeared in court when you were supposed to. </li></ol><p> If the reason you did not go to court was because you were not served with a copy of the claim, you have up to 180 days after you find out about the Default Judgment against you to file the Notice of Motion to Vacate Judgment form. </p><p> When you file the form, the Small Claims clerk will set a date on which you and the person suing you are to appear in court. The judge will decide to vacate the judgment against you or not. </p><p> Bring whatever evidence you can to the hearing to show why you were unable to come to court the first time. An example of what to bring might be a letter from a doctor or a hospital bill.</p><p> If the judge agrees to vacate the judgment, the original case will probably be heard right then. Be prepared to tell your side of the story and present your evidence in an organized and concise manner at that time. </p><p> If you have witnesses to help your case who could not be present, you can ask the judge for a continuance. The judge may or may not grant the continuance. </p><p><b> Appeal \u2013 If the Motion to Vacate the Judgment is denied </b></p><p> If the judge decides not to vacate the judgment, you can only appeal the judge's denial of the Motion to Vacate. You cannot appeal the judgment against you. You must file the appeal within 10 days of the judge's decision</p><p> To file the appeal, get a \"<a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc140.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">Notice of Filing Notice of Appeal</a>\" form from the Small Claims clerk or online through the Judicial Council website. Fill it out and file it with the Small Claims clerk; a fee is required at the time the appeal is filed with the Small Claims clerk. See How to Appeal a Judgment for more information about appeals.</p><p> If the judge decides not to grant your appeal and not to vacate the judgment, you are responsible for paying the judgment.</p><p> If the judge does grant your appeal and vacates the judgment, the original case will usually be heard right then. Be prepared to present your case, including any evidence you have, at the time of the hearing. Remember, your case will only be heard if the judge grants your appeal. </p><h4> Additional Information on Specific Topics </h4><p> The California Small Claims Court Information Center provides general information on Small Claims topics.

Interpreters must be of adult age and not a party named in the claim. </p><p><b> The Court does not generally provide Interpreters </b></p><h5>Monetary Claim Limits for Small Claims Court</h5><p> The Small Claims court has a monetary claim limit for money damages.

Generally, a party may not be represented by anyone else; however, there are some exceptions to the appearance requirement: </p><ul><li>If the Defendant is the owner of real property in California and lives out of state, the owner can be represented in court by one other person, provided they are not an attorney, or the owner can submit written declarations instead of appearing in person.</li><li> A member of the armed forces, on active duty and assigned outside the state after his or her claim arose, need not appear if the active duty assignment is longer than six months. </li></ul><p> Plaintiffs and Defendant business entities: </p><ul><li>In cases where a claim can be proved or disputed by evidence of a business record, and there is no other issue, the business may authorize an employee who is qualified to testify about the business record to appear on behalf of the business. </li><li> If the business entity subject to a dispute is a sole proprietorship the, owner must appear in court.

Consult the <b>Small Claims Advisor</b> for more information regarding the limits on jurisdiction. </p><h5>Statute of Limitations</h5><p> The Statute of Limitations is the deadline for filing a lawsuit. The deadline for filing a California Small Claims action depends on the type of claim. </p><p> Consult the <b>Small Claims Advisor</b> for more information regarding statute of limitations. </p><h5>Venue</h5><ul><li> The defendant lives or does business (if the defendant is a business or organization); or </li><li> The dispute arose, for example, where the contract was signed or where the accident occurred. </li></ul><p> Consult the Small Claims Advisor for more information regarding venue or if there is a belief the party filing the claim has filed it in the wrong venue. </p><h5> Appeals </h5><p> A party who disagrees with the court's decision/judgment <b>on the other parties' claim</b>, may appeal the decision/judgment.

{"url": "https://www.monterey.courts.ca.gov/small-claims", "title": "Small Claims", "body": "<div class=\"jumbotron white\" style=\"margin: 2vw;\"><div><h4>Time and Location</h4><p> Small Claims Court Trials are held on Thursdays at 8:30 AM and 1:30 PM in Department 20 located at the Marina Courthouse, 3180 Del Monte Boulevard, Marina, CA 93933. The party filing the claim may request that the Processing Clerk set the Court Trial on the morning calendar or the afternoon calendar. </p><p> Parties should arrive at the courthouse at least 15 minutes prior to the time set for the Court Trial. </p><p> NOTE: Small Claims documents are filed and processed at the Monterey Courthouse located at 1200 Aguajito Road, Monterey, CA 93940. </p><hr><h4>Small Claims Mediation Program</h4><p><strong>What is mediation?</strong></p><p> Mediation is a confidential, voluntary process in which a trained mediator facilitates communication between the parties and assists parties in reaching a mutually acceptable resolution of all or part of their dispute. Mediation is a flexible and less formal process that may reduce the time and costs often associated with the trial. If an agreement is reached, the parties can agree to make it legally enforceable. </p><p> Mediation may be particularly useful when parties have a relationship they want to preserve. For example, when family members, neighbors, or business partners have a dispute, mediation may be the most effective process to use. Mediation is also effective when emotions are getting in the way of resolution. An effective mediator can hear the parties and help them communicate with each other in an effective and constructive manner. </p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/yA0na4pOTdI\" class=\"btn btn-warning custom-btn\">Click here for a video regarding mediation</a><p><strong>Will a mediator decide my case?</strong></p><p> No. The mediator is not the decision-maker and does not resolve the dispute -- the parties do. The mediators are impartial and do not give legal advice. However, a mediator is often able to more fully explore the parties' underlying interests, needs and priorities. The parties involved in the dispute make the decisions and the mediators and the parties work together to identify the issues that are most important for each side and then to find practical resolutions. </p><p><strong>What is the court's policy regarding mediation for small claims cases?</strong></p><p> It is the policy of the small claims court that all small claims actions are referred to mediation prior to their hearing. The mediation services are free to all participants. </p><p> Mediation is offered and encouraged by the court for all small claims participants but is not mandated. </p><p><strong>Is there a cost to participate in the mediation?</strong></p><p> No. There is no cost to participate in the mediation that is court referred and conducted by the Mandell-Gisnet Center. </p><p><strong>What is the process to attend mediation? </strong></p><p> Once you have served your claim or you have been served with a claim, you are to: </p><ol><li> Contact the Mandell-Gisnet Center at (831) 582-5234 at least 5 days before your hearing. </li><li><p> Once you contact the Mandell-Gisnet Center, a representative will reserve your mediation session hour that will take place two days before your trial. You will be given either log in instructions or the telephone number that you will need to call to appear by on-line video (such as Zoom) or telephonically for your session. </p><p> Note: Only the parties named in the action participate in the mediation session (witnesses do not participate and should not be present). </p></li><li><p> Parties that complete and reach a settlement agreement will receive instructions from the Mandell-Gisnet Center with regards to the signature of the agreement. The parties' agreement will be filed with the court and they will not be required to appear in court. </p><p> Parties that are not able to reach a settlement agreement will be required to appear for the trial and will be required to show all documentary evidence concerning their claim (including photographs and any other material) to the other party. </p></li></ol><p><strong>What happens if I or the other party fails to attend the mediation session?</strong></p><p> If either party fails to attend the mediation session and would still like to participate in mediation, the case may be continued to a different date, usually the next available court date, and the parties re-referred to mediation. </p><p><strong>What will happen at my on-line video or telephonic mediation session?</strong></p><p> Specially trained mediators from the Mandell-Gisnet Center will meet with both parties either by an on-line video platform, such as Zoom, or telephonically at the same time. </p><p> The mediators will work with a 40-minute time frame to identify the issues that are most important for each side and then to help the parties develop and find a practical resolution. While mediators work within this time frame, it may be that an agreement can often be reached more quickly. However, if more time is needed, the Center can notify the court to grant a continuance to allow for completion of the process. </p><p> Once an agreement is reached, a written agreement is drafted and there may be a clause allowing the agreement to be converted to a judgment if one of the parties defaults. The agreement reached at the mediation can be entered into the court record without having to appear in court. </p><p> If a settlement agreement cannot be reached your case will proceed to trial on the date provided on the claim and a judicial officer will decide the outcome. </p><p><strong>What are the advantages of mediation?</strong></p><p> There are several advantages of mediation. Below are some highlights of the advantages of mediation: </p><p><i>Mediation is confidential.</i> Only the parties directly involved in the suit attend the mediation session. Mediators cannot be called to court to testify about the mediation session and offers made in mediation may be restated in court only by the party who made them. By contrast, a trial is open to the public and all information related to the trial is a matter of public record. A judgment may appear on the debtor's credit record for a period of seven years. </p><p><i>Mediation is flexible.</i> The parties can create options that work for both sides and develop practical solutions. In a trial, a judgment is based strictly on the law and the evidence presented. Plaintiffs who lose may not appeal. Defendants may appeal in Superior Court, but expenses and time frames are much greater. </p><p><i>Mediated agreements protect both parties.</i> The court keeps the original copy of the agreement until the terms are met. If the terms are not met (one of the parties defaults), the agreement can be converted to a judgment. However, experience has shown that mediated settlement agreements are rarely defaulted because they are the work of both sides. </p></div><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----></div>", "parent": ""},

In juvenile justice cases, the Court can also order children to be confined in locked facilities, such as detention halls, camps, and the Division of Juvenile Justice.</p><h5>Center for Families, Children &amp; the Courts</h5><p>The Judicial Council/Administrative Office of the Courts' Center for Families, Children &amp; the Courts was established to maximize the effectiveness of court services for children and families, implement innovative court-related programs for them, and promote those services in the legal community and to the public.

The minor, his or her parents or legal guardian(s), and attorneys of record may obtain copies of court minute orders and selected court documents by appearing at the juvenile records counter with photo identification. The records will not be mailed and other individuals must utilize the \"Petition for Disclosure of Juvenile Court Records Welfare and Institutions Code \u00a7827\" <a href=\"https://www.sb-court.org/sites/default/files/Divisions/Juvenile/jv570.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">https://www.sb-court.org/sites/default/files/Divisions/Juvenile/jv570.pdf</a> .

If the petition is granted, viewing and/or receipt of copies may only occur by appearing in person with proper photo identification. The records will not be mailed. </p><h5>Sealing Juvenile Records</h5><p>If you were arrested or involved in a court case or had contact with the juvenile justice system when you were under 18, the courts, police, schools, or other public agencies may have records about what you did. You may be able to have those records sealed. This could make it easier for you to find a job, get a driver's license, get a loan, rent an apartment, or go to college. In some cases, the court will automatically order your records sealed. In others, you must file a petition asking the court to seal your records.</p><p> For more information about sealing your juvenile record: <a href=\"https://www.courts.ca.gov/28120.htm?rdeLocaleAttr=en\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">https://www.courts.ca.gov/28120.htm?rdeLocaleAttr=en</a></p></div><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----></div>", "parent": ""},

The Superior Court of California is a trial court and its decisions are reviewed by the <strong>appellate courts</strong>, which are the Courts of Appeal and the Supreme Court. </p><p>The <strong>Superior Court</strong> is unique in that it functions as a trial court for criminal and civil cases. Additionally, the superior court has an appellate division which has jurisdiction over appeals from decisions in limited civil cases and misdemeanor and infraction cases. These appeals, other than those in small claims cases, are heard by a three-judge panel and are governed by rules adopted by the Judicial Council. The Superior Court consists of a presiding judge and judges who serve six-year terms and are elected by county voters. Judicial appointments are made by the Governor when vacancies occur before the end of a term. Each of California's 58 counties has a superior court. </p><p>The <strong>Appellate Court</strong> reviews trial decisions made by the Superior Court on unlimited jurisdiction matters; unlimited civil cases, felony or juvenile cases and has original jurisdiction in habeas corpus, mandamus, certiorari, and prohibition proceedings. There are six appellate districts in the State of California; First District, San Francisco; Second District, Los Angeles (with one division in Ventura); Third District, Sacramento; Fourth District, San Diego, San Bernardino, and Santa Ana; Fifth District, Fresno; and Sixth District, San Jose. The Appellate Court consists of a Presiding \"Justice\" and two or three Associate Justices who are appointed by the Governor and must be confirmed by the Commission on Judicial Appointments.</p><p>Cases are decided by three-judge panels. Decisions of the panels, known as opinions, are published in the California Appellate Reports if they meet certain criteria for publication. In general, opinions are published if they establish a new rule of law, involve a legal issue of continuing public interest, criticize existing law, or make a significant contribution to legal literature.</p><p>The <strong>Supreme Court</strong> of California is the state's highest court. Its venue is the entire state, and its decisions are binding on all other California state courts. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court includes reviewing decisions made by the state's courts of appeal, deciding all appeals from cases in which a judgment of death has been pronounced by the trial court and issuing special writs. Regular court sessions are held in Los Angeles, Sacramento, and at the court's headquarters in San Francisco. The Supreme Court consists of the Chief Justice of California and six Associate Justices. Decisions of the Supreme Court are published in the California Reports. </p><hr><h4>THE COURTROOM</h4><p>The Courtroom is a room where formal court proceedings are held. The Courtroom is a quiet and dignified setting reflecting the importance and seriousness of legal matters brought before the Court.</p><p>The courtroom is divided into two parts by a barrier known as the bar. The bar may be an actual railing or a barrier. On one side of the bar is the bench where the Judge sits and across the bench are the counsel tables where the plaintiff, defendant, and their respective counsel sit. To one side of the bench are the witness stand and a separate group of seats known as the jury box where the jury is seated. The court clerk, court reporter, interpreter and bailiff are also seated in this area. To the other side of the bar is an open area with seating provided for the general public, referred to as the gallery. </p><p>All persons entering a courtroom must conduct themselves in a respectful manner. Members of the public are generally allowed to observe courtroom proceedings.</p><p>When entering a courtroom, individuals must remain quiet when observing or waiting for a matter to be called by the Judge. </p><p>Cell telephones, cameras and all other electronic equipment must be turned off before entering the courtroom. Food, drinks and chewing gum are not permitted in the courtroom. Court security officers are authorized to open and inspect any item carried into a courtroom. Wearing of hats is strictly prohibited except in accordance with religious beliefs. </p><p>No one, except for the judge, defendant's attorney, and Sheriff's office personnel may attempt to communicate with an in-custody defendant. Anyone who attempts to communicate with in-custody defendants will be subject to arrest. </p><p>The bailiff will announce when the Judge is entering the courtroom, and everyone in the courtroom, unless physically unable, must rise when the Judge enters and shall remain standing until the Judge requires everyone to be seated. </p><p>If you are making a court appearance, when your case is called, the bailiff will direct you to stand in front of the counsel table. When the Judge speaks to you, do not interrupt. When addressing the Judge, always refer to him/her as \"Your Honor\" or \"Judge.\" Speak clearly and loudly, as the court proceedings are either being recorded electronically or reported by a court reporter. </p><a href=\"https://mscpublicwebsiteprd.blob.core.windows.net/publicwebsiteprd/Misc/Request%20for%20Accommodations:%20Please%20Inform%20the%20Clerk's%20Office,%20Security%20or%20the%20Bailiff%20if%20you%20require%20special%20accommodations.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">Request for Accommodations: Please Inform the Clerk's Office, Security or the Bailiff if you require special accommodations </a><hr><h4>THE ROLE OF THE JUDGE</h4><p>The Judge presides over a court of law, applies the law, oversees the legal process in court proceedings and issues a ruling on the matter at hand based on his or her interpretation of the law. </p><p>The Judge sits behind a raised desk, known as the bench. Behind or to the side of the Judge are the great seal of the jurisdiction and the flags of the appropriate federal and state governments. The Judge wears a plain black robe. The robe symbolizes the law, authority and neutrality. The gavel is also a symbol of authority, and judges have historically used gavels to make a sound of authority to bring a courtroom to order or adjourn a court session. </p><p>The Judge must ensure that all court hearings are conducted fairly and safeguard the legal rights of all parties involved, which is referred to as due process. Due process is the principle that the government respects the legal rights that are owed to a person according to the law. Due process includes the right to a fair and public hearing by the court. </p><p>California law is divided into two categories: criminal and civil. Generally, a court is considered the proper trial court if the criminal matter occurred within its venue. For civil matters, the proper venue may be where the defendant lives, where the accident or injury occurred, where the contract or obligation was to be performed, or where the real property is located. </p><p>In a criminal case, an arraignment is held, at which time the Judge informs the defendant of the charges filed against him/her. The defendant may plead guilty to the charges or not guilty and the defendant may ask for a trial. </p><p>In a civil case, the Judge will usually meet with the attorneys to determine if the case can be resolved or settled without having a trial. In a civil case, the settlement usually involves private disputes, contracts, and family and probate law. If the civil case cannot be settled between the parties, it will be scheduled for trial. </p><p>The most visible responsibility of judges is presiding over trials or hearings as attorneys represent their clients. Judges rule on the admissibility of evidence and the methods of conducting testimony, and they may be called on to settle disputes between opposing attorneys. Also, Judges ensure that rules and procedures are followed, and if unusual circumstances arise for which standard procedures have not been established, judges interpret the law to determine how the trial will proceed. </p><p>In many trials, juries are selected to decide guilt or innocence in criminal cases or liability and compensation in civil cases. Judges instruct juries on applicable laws, direct them to deduce the facts from the evidence presented, and hear their verdict. </p><p>When the law does not require a jury trial or when the parties waive their right to a jury, judges decide cases. In such instances, the judge determines guilt in criminal cases and imposes sentences on the guilty; in civil cases, the judge awards relief\u2014such as compensation for damages\u2014to the winning parties to the lawsuit. </p><hr><h4>JUDGE'S CHAMBERS</h4><img src=\"assets/chamber.jpg\" style=\"width: 30%;\"><p>The Judge's chambers is an office near the courtroom where the Judge meets with attorneys, reads court files, researches legal issues and writes opinions. Unlike the courtroom, a judge's chambers is not open to the public. </p><p>Some Judges, in between court proceedings, will conduct pretrial conferences in their chambers with the plaintiff's counsel and the defendant's counsel to discuss and to try to settle the case with an agreement. If an agreement is reached, the Judge will go back into the courtroom with the attorneys and state the agreement on the official court record. If an agreement is not reached, the case will go to trial. </p><hr><h4>ROLE OF THE BAILIFF</h4><p>A courtroom bailiff, a law enforcement officer of the Monterey County Sheriff's Office, is responsible for providing security and enforcing the law in and around the courthouse. The bailiff provides the following security services:</p><ul><li>For Judicial Officers, courtroom personnel, jurors and members of the public;</li><li>Escorts in-custody defendants to and from court proceedings; and</li><li>Takes charge of the jury during the time of deliberation to assure that no unauthorized persons come into contact with members of the jury. </li></ul><p>The bailiff maintains order and prevention of unnecessary disturbances in and about the courtroom and ensures no one approaches the bench without the approval of the Judge. The bailiff also ensures the courtroom is secure and orderly. At the beginning of the day, between court sessions, and at the end of the day, the bailiff inspects the courtroom for weapons, contraband, suspicious objects, and safety hazards. </p><p>The bailiff makes an announcement in open court when the Judge is about to enter the courtroom to take the bench by stating \"All rise, the Honorable Judge (name) presiding, please be seated.\" </p><hr><h4>ROLE OF THE COURTROOM CLERK</h4><p>The courtroom clerk sits in the courtroom near the Judge and prepares the minutes of the court proceedings. The courtroom clerk also administers oaths to witnesses and interpreters, secures records and exhibits, prepares criminal judgments and verdict forms and generally assists the Judge in managing the court calendars. </p><p>The courtroom clerk is employed by the Superior Court. Typically, one or two courtroom clerks support each Judge in a court. </p><hr><h4>ROLE OF THE COURT INTERPRETER</h4><p>The state Constitution guarantees that \"a person unable to understand English who is charged with a crime has a right to an interpreter throughout the proceedings.\" </p><p>A court interpreter is a person who interprets a criminal court proceeding for a defendant or witness who speaks or understands little or no English. The role of the interpreter is to allow a non-English-speaking defendant or witness to participate in judicial proceedings. Interpreters must render a complete and accurate interpretation, without altering, omitting, or adding anything to what is stated or written. </p><p>The court interpreter interprets exactly what the witness or defendant says, without commenting on it. If a witness does not understand a question, the interpreter must translate the witness's request for explanation to the attorney or whoever asked the question, and that person will explain or rephrase what he or she said. The interpreter then translates the rephrased words for the witness. </p><p>The English rendition provided by the interpreter becomes the official court record. </p><hr><h4>ROLE OF THE COURT REPORTER</h4><p>The court reporter sits near the witness stand in the courtroom and records every word that is spoken during the trial or introduced into evidence by typing on a stenographic machine. This verbatim record becomes the official record of the trial. The court reporter also produces a written transcript of the proceedings as ordered by the court or upon request by either party. </p><p>The court reporter uses a stenographic machine that has 22 keys. Using these 22 keys, a court reporter uses symbols to record what is said in court. The stenographic machine has a computer to help convert the symbols into the English words spoken in Court.</p><p>A court reporter may also be required to read out loud in court from the transcription on the stenographic machine. The court reporter may also be asked to read back portions of the official Court record for a jury. </p><hr><h4>ROLE OF THE ATTORNEY</h4><p>The Attorney sits at the counsel tables near the bench. The attorney will speak to the judge, a witness, or the jury. </p><p>In a criminal case, the government's lawyer--the Prosecutor --is a representative from the District Attorney's office. The defendant may be represented by a Public Defender, a lawyer appointed by the court, a private attorney hired by the defendant, or occasionally defendants will decide to proceed without an attorney. In a civil case, the parties will hire their own lawyers, or appear without counsel. </p><p>Generally, there are two sides in a courtroom proceeding. One side, called the plaintiff, is seeking a remedy for an injury or to a violation of rights. The plaintiff is also called the complainant. A plaintiff can be the government, a corporation, a group of people or a single individual. The other side is the defendant, who is accused of causing an injury or of violating the plaintiff's rights. The defendant is also called the respondent. </p><p>A plaintiff's attorney represents the plaintiff and explains to a judge what happened between the plaintiff and the defendant and why it happened. The attorney for the plaintiff wants to prove that what happened was not legal and that it should be remedied. </p><p>A defendant's attorney represents the defendant, and explains to a judge what happened between the plaintiff and the defendant and why it happened. The attorney for the defendant wants to prove what happened was legal. The defendant can be the government, a corporation, a group of people or a single individual. </p><hr><h4>ROLE OF THE WITNESS</h4><p>The witness gives testimony about the facts or issues in the case that are in dispute. During the testimony, the witness sits on the witness stand, facing the courtroom. Because the witness is asked to testify by one party or the other, they are often referred to as the plaintiff's witness, government witness, or defense witness. </p><p>The witness must swear under oath or affirm that the testimony is true and accurate to the best of the witness's knowledge as to what he/she may have heard or seen.</p><hr><h4>ROLE OF THE JURY</h4><p>The jury is seated in the boxed-in area on one side of the courtroom. A jury is a group of 12 individuals sworn to hear the evidence presented in a case. One or more alternate jurors are selected in the event a sworn juror is unable to complete the trial for health or other reasons. Alternates hear the trial but do not take part in deciding the verdict unless a juror is unable to deliberate. </p><p>The jury's role is to decide the facts in the case and apply the law on which the Judge has instructed them in order to reach a verdict. </p><p>In cases in which there is conflicting evidence, it is the jury's responsibility to resolve the conflict and decide what really happened. For example, in a criminal case, the jury might listen to the testimony of a witness who claims they/he/she saw the defendant commit the crime and then listen to the testimony of the defendant's friend, who claims the defendant was with him/her in another part of town when the crime was committed.</p><p>In a criminal case, the jury must unanimously decide whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty of a crime as charged. In a civil case, the jury must decide by a majority of votes, whether or not a party accused of some wrongdoing or negligence is liable. </p><p>It is the jury's role to decide the facts in the case and apply the law on which the judge has instructed it to reach a verdict. Typically, a jury must come to a unanimous decision before delivering a verdict; however, there are exceptions. When a unanimous decision is not reached and the jury feels that one is not possible, they declare themselves a hung jury, a mistrial is declared and the trial may be retried at the discretion of the plaintiff. </p><hr><h4>Courtroom Vocabulary Words</h4><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\"><tbody><tr><td><p>Acquittal:</p></td><td><p>A legal determination that a person who has been charged with a crime is innocent.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Appeal:</p></td><td><p>A request for a higher court to review a decision made by a lower court.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Conviction:</p></td><td><p>The result of a criminal trial in which a person is found guilty.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Cross-examination:</p></td><td><p>The questioning of a witness by the lawyer for the opposing side.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Deliberation:</p></td><td><p>The process in which a jury trial discusses in private the evidence presented in court and decides by vote on a verdict.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Direct-examination:</p></td><td><p>In a trial, the first questioning of a witness by the lawyer who called that witness.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hung Jury:</p></td><td><p>A trial in where a jury cannot agree upon a verdict after an extended period of deliberation.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Indictment:</p></td><td><p>An accusation of a crime made against a person by a grand jury upon the request of a prosecutor.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Information:</p></td><td><p>An accusation of a crime, made against a person by the prosecutor.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jury Trial:</p></td><td><p>A group of citizens that listen to the evidence presented by both sides at trial and figure out the facts in dispute.

Many defendants retain the services of a private attorney and pay the attorney directly. For defendants who cannot afford a private attorney, you will be required to complete a Financial Declaration form to assist the Judge in determining if you are financially eligible for indigent defense services. Prior to the beginning of the court session, the bailiff will announce that individuals requesting a court appointed attorney will need to complete a Financial Declaration form before their name is called by the Judge. If eligible, the Court will appoint an attorney for any defendant who needs representation through the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.co.monterey.ca.us/government/departments-i-z/public-defender\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">Office of the Public Defender or Alternate Public Defender's Office.</a></p><p>The Court cannot recommend an attorney. Information on low-cost or no-cost attorney options to qualifying individuals will be provided to you on the day of your court appearance.</p><hr><h4>Arraignment</h4><p>The Arraignment is generally the first court hearing on a criminal Complaint, Information, Indictment or Petition for Violation of Probation.</p><p>If you have retained a private attorney, your attorney should be present for your arraignment. If you do not have an attorney, you may ask the judge to appoint an attorney for you at no cost to you, or you may ask for additional time to retain your own attorney.</p><p>The Judge will inform you of the charge(s) against you and advise you of your constitutional rights. The Judge will then ask how you plea to the charge or charges.</p><h5>Pleas</h5><ul><li>A plea of <strong>GUILTY</strong> is an admission of guilt to the charge(s) against you.</li><li>A plea of <strong>NO CONTEST</strong> means that you do not wish to contest the charge(s) against you. Although such a plea will result in your conviction, you will not be admitting any liability should there be a subsequent lawsuit filed for personal injury or property damage arising from the incident for which you were cited. An example of this would be a traffic accident. If you were the driver who was charged with failure to yield the right-of-way, a No Contest plea to this charge is not an admission of guilt, and could not be used against you in any lawsuit for damages arising from the accident. </li><li>A plea of <strong>NOT GUILTY</strong> means that you feel you have a defense to the charge(s) or believe the charge(s) is incorrect. You will be asked if you will be hiring an attorney to represent you or if you need a court-appointed attorney. </li></ul><p>See Misdemeanor Courtroom Process or Felony Courtroom Process for further information.</p><hr><h4>Misdemeanor Court</h4><h5>Misdemeanor Arraignment</h5><p>At a misdemeanor arraignment, the defendant enters a plea to the charge of guilty, no contest or not guilty.</p><p>When a plea of <strong>Guilty or No Contest</strong> is entered, the defendant will be asked if he/she wishes to be sentenced immediately or return another day for the sentence to be imposed. The defendant will be given an opportunity to tell the Judge about any mitigating circumstances surrounding the charge which might affect the sentence.</p><p>When a plea of <strong>Not Guilty</strong> is entered, the defendant will be asked if they will be hiring an attorney, representing themselves or requesting a court-appointed attorney. If the defendant is requesting a court-appointed attorney, the court will review the completed Financial Declaration form and determine if the defendant qualifies.</p><ul><li>If the defendant does not qualify, the case will be continued for \"Further Arraignment\" to provide an opportunity for the defendant to contact a private attorney; </li><li>If the defendant does qualify, the judge will appoint the Public Defender and the case will be continued 2 \u2013 3 weeks for a Pretrial Conference. </li></ul><h5>Pretrial Conference</h5><p>A Pretrial conference is a meeting with the judge, district attorney (prosecutor) and defense attorney to discuss the settlement of the case. In complex cases, the pretrial conference is held to discuss constitutional issues (confessions, searches, identification, etc). These issues are generally presented to the court through written \"motions\" (e.g., Motion to Suppress Evidence, etc.). </p><h5>Trial (Judge or Jury)</h5><p>A trial is a proceeding in which the prosecutor must present evidence to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecutor calls witnesses and presents other evidence to prove the crime, and the defense attorney may question those witnesses and also present witnesses and other evidence to support a defense. Both the defendant and the prosecutor have the right to a trial by a jury. Sometimes both sides agree that a judge may listen to the evidence and decide the case without a jury, referred to as a \"Court Trial.\" In a jury trial, the jury is the \"trier of fact\"; in a court trial, the judge is the \"trier of fact.\" After the evidence is presented, the \"trier of fact\" will determine whether the evidence proved that the defendant committed the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. If the defendant is found not guilty, the case ends. If the defendant is found guilty, a sentencing date will be set. </p><h5>Sentencing</h5><p>At the time of sentencing, the Judge will consider the facts of the case to determine the appropriate sentence. The Judge will consult \"sentencing guidelines\", which aid the court in deciding upon an appropriate sentence and may consider alternatives, such as fines, probation, and/or a county jail sentence. The Judge must also order the defendant to make restitution to any victims who have suffered any losses. </p><hr><h4>Felony Court</h4><h5>Felony Arraignment (Complaint)</h5><p>At a felony arraignment, the defendant enters a plea to the charge of either guilty, no contest or not guilty. The defendant is advised of his/her right to a preliminary hearing within 10 court days of the arraignment. If the defendant requests a court-appointed attorney, the court will review that request at the time of the arraignment. </p><h5>Preliminary Hearing</h5><p>This is a contested hearing before a judge, sometimes called a \"probable cause hearing.\" The prosecutor presents witnesses to establish that there is probable cause to believe that a crime was committed and that the defendant committed the crime. Because the burden of proof is much less than what is required at a trial, the prosecutor generally does not call all potential witnesses to testify at the \"prelim;\" generally, the victim, eye witnesses and the investigating officers on the case may testify.The defendant's attorney can cross examine the witnesses, call witnesses and present evidence. If probable cause is established, the defendant is \"bound over\" or \"held to answer\" for trial. If the Judge decides that there is no probable cause that the defendant committed the crime, the charge can be dismissed or reduced to a misdemeanor. A defendant can decide to waive a Preliminary Hearing. If this occurs, the case will go directly to arraignment.</p><h5>Arraignment (Information)</h5><p>After the case is \"bound over\" or \"held to answer\", the defendant is again arraigned (given formal notice of the charges against him/her). The charging document is called an Information. He/she is again advised of his/her constitutional rights, and enters a plea to the charge (not guilty, guilty or no contest).</p><h5>Pretrial Conference</h5><p>As with misdemeanors, the Judge is called upon to resolve various pretrial issues, some of which determine whether the case will continue to a trial, be resolved with a plea, or be dismissed.</p><h5>Trial (Judge or Jury)</h5><p>A trial is a proceeding in which the prosecutor must present evidence to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecutor calls all the necessary witnesses. Both the defendant and the prosecutor (representing the People of the State of California) have the right to a trial by a jury. Sometimes both sides agree to let a judge listen to the evidence and decide the case without a jury which is referred to as a \"Court Trial\". In a jury trial, the jury is the \"trier of fact;\" in a court trial, the \"trier of fact\" is the judge. After the evidence is presented, the judge or a jury will determine whether the evidence proved that the defendant committed the crime. If the defendant is found not guilty, the case ends. If the defendant is found guilty, a sentencing date will be set.</p><h5>Pre-Sentence Investigation and Report</h5><p>The probation department prepares a report for the Judge summarizing the crime and the defendant's personal and criminal backgrounds. Generally, the victim is contacted for a recommendation of sentence. The probation officer concludes the report with a recommended sentence. </p><h5>Sentencing</h5><p>At the time of sentencing, the Judge will consider the information in the pre-sentence report before determining the sentence. The parties may offer additional evidence relevant to the Judge's sentencing decision. The Judge will consult \"sentencing guidelines\", which aid the court in deciding upon an appropriate sentence. The Judge may consider different alternatives, such as a fine, probation, a sentence to county jail or prison, or a combination. The Judge must also order the defendant to make restitution to any victims who have suffered any physical or financial losses.</p><hr><h4>Domestic Violence Court </h4><p>The Monterey County Superior Court operates a specialized court for criminal domestic violence charges. The domestic Violence Court was created to provide specialization and efficiency in the handling of the increasing number of domestic violence cases being filed in the County.</p><p>One significant difference in the Domestic Violence Court is that the defendant may be served with a Criminal Protective Order. A Criminal Protective Order is a restraining order ordering the defendant to stay away from the alleged victim(s) with other conditions. </p><p>For additional information on other types of restraining orders, please visit the <a class=\"anchor-tag-inline\" href=\"/self-help\">Court's Self-Help Center</a> section. </p><h5>What is a Criminal Protective Order? (CPO)</h5><p>A criminal domestic violence protective order is a restraining order issued under the Domestic Violence Prevention Act. This act was passed to protect victims of domestic violence. </p><p>The Judge may order a criminal protective order to protect the victim(s) that has a relationship with the defendant and fits one of the following categories: </p><ul><li>Relative</li><li>Living together</li><li>Relative by marriage</li><li>Children in common</li><li>Dating</li></ul><h5>Arraignments</h5><p>The courtroom proceedings are similar to the misdemeanor proceedings or felony proceedings based on the pending charges.</p><h5>Sentencing requirements:</h5><p>Penal Code Section 1203.97, requires that if a person is granted probation for a domestic related charge, as defined in Section 6211 of the Family Code, the terms of probation shall include: </p><ul><li>A minimum period of probation for 36 months, which may include a period of formal probation. Formal probation requires the defendant to report to a probation officer; </li><li>A criminal court protective order protecting the victim from further acts of violence, threats, stalking, sexual abuse, and harassment, and, if appropriate, containing residence exclusion or stay-away conditions; </li><li>Jail or Prison (based on if the charge is a misdemeanor or felony);</li><li>Participation in a 52 week batterer's treatment program, with periodic progress reports by the program to the court; </li><li>Pay fees to the Domestic Violence Restraining Order Reimbursement Fund, the Domestic Violence Training and Education Fund and a Victim Restitution Fund; and </li><li>Other court orders as required by statute or as deemed necessary.</li></ul><h5>To Remove a Criminal Protective Order </h5><p>If you are the Protected Person, contact the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.co.monterey.ca.us/government/departments-a-h/district-attorney\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">Office of the District Attorney</a> \u2013 Victim \u2013 Witness Assistance Unit to assist you. </p><p>If you are the defendant, contact your attorney or schedule a court appearance date to request the Criminal Protective Order be modified.</p><hr><h4>Drug Court</h4><p>The Monterey County Superior Court operates a specialized court for drug related charges. Drug Treatment Court was created to provide specialization and efficiency in the handling of the increasing number of drug related cases being filed in the County. The judicial officer in a Drug Treatment Court develops expertise in handling issues unique to drug cases - providing sensitive, consistent sentencing and firm oversight on each case. </p><p><strong>Deferred Entry of Judgment Drug Program \u2013 Misdemeanors (PC \u00a71000.1)</strong></p><p>One common form of diversion is called Deferred Entry of Judgment or DEJ. It is usually offered to a first-time drug offender who is charged with under the influence or simple possession of drugs for personal use.</p><p>The Deferred Entry of Judgment program is implemented through collaboration between the Superior Court, Monterey County Probation Department, Monterey County Behavioral Health services, the District Attorney's Office, the Public Defender's Office and treatment providers. </p><p>For Deferred Entry, the eligible defendant enters a guilty plea to the underlying charge(s). The Judge places the defendant on a deferred entry of judgment (diversion) program for a maximum of 18 months. Defendant(s) are referred to the court approved program, which includes mandatory counseling sessions at Valley Health Associates.</p><p>Upon successful completion of a deferred entry of judgment program, the arrest upon which the judgment was deferred shall be deemed to have never occurred. The defendant may indicate in response to any question concerning his or her prior criminal record that he or she was not arrested or granted deferred entry of judgment for the offense, except as specified in Penal Code section 1001 subdivision (b). A record pertaining to an arrest resulting in successful completion of a deferred entry of judgment program shall not, without the defendant's consent, be used in any way that could result in the denial of any employment, benefit, license, or certificate.</p><p><strong>Note: Deferred entry of judgment only applies to eligible drug related offense(s). </strong></p><h5>Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act Program - Felony (PC \u00a71210) </h5><p>The Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act (SACPA) passed by voters in November, 2000, is also known as Prop 36. This is a different type of diversion program that is designed for nonviolent offenders who are charged with simple drug possession with a prior offense. Prop 36 is an alternative treatment to jail and the increasing costs of incarceration with a strong and lengthy rehabilitation program including SLE (sober living environments), outpatient treatment, and drug education classes.</p><p>The SACPA program is implemented through a collaboration between the Superior Court, Monterey County Probation Department, Monterey County Behavioral Health services, the District Attorney's Office, the Public Defender's Office, California's Parole and Community Services Division, treatment providers, and other community organizations. </p><p>In court, the eligible defendant pleads \"guilty\" or \"no contest\" to the underlying charge. The judge then places him/her on probation. A term of the probation is that the defendant successfully completes a drug rehabilitation program.</p><p>Defendants are supervised by a Probation Officer assigned to the unit. The officers ensure compliance with court orders by making referrals to treatment programs and conducting home visits, property searches, and random drug testing.</p><p>As participants progress through the phases of the program, they are held accountable to program requirements. If they are non-compliant, they may receive sanctions ranging from writing an essay, community service, jail time, and program termination. Participants are also rewarded with incentives for positive behavior, such as phase advancements, decreased program requirements, drawings for movie tickets, and program graduation. </p><p>Upon successful completion of the drug treatment program, the conviction shall be set aside and the indictment, complaint or information is ordered dismissed; both the arrest and conviction shall be deemed never to have occurred. The defendant shall be released from all penalties resulting from the offense of which he or she has been convicted except for the following restrictions: </p><ol><li>Does not permit the person to own, possess, or have in his or her custody or control any firearm capable of being concealed upon the person or prevent his or her conviction under Penal Code Section 12021; and </li><li>Does not relieve a defendant of the obligation to disclose the arrest and conviction in response to any direct question contained in any questionnaire or application for public office, for a position as a peace officer as defined in Penal Code Section 830, for licensure by any state or local agency, for contracting with the California State Lottery, or for purposes of serving on a jury. </li></ol><p>A record pertaining to an arrest resulting in successful completion of drug treatment program shall not, without the defendant's consent, be used in any way that could result in the denial of any employment, benefit, license, or certificate.</p><p>If the defendant fails to complete the drug treatment program, or otherwise violates the terms of probation, the Judge can sentence him/her on the charge. Those penalties could include jail time or a California state prison sentence.</p><h5>Drug Treatment Court (DTC) (Penal Code \u00a71001.5)</h5><p>The Drug Treatment Court (DTC) model includes a higher level of supervision, particularly by the Court and a standardized treatment program for the participants, including phases that each participant must pass through by meeting certain goals. There is also regular and frequent drug testing more so than the Deferred Entry of Judgment Drug Program or the Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Program. </p><p>In order to participate in the Drug Treatment Court Program (DTC), defendants must have a history of or evidence of present drug abuse or addiction and their abuse or addiction is at least one motivating factor in the commission of their crime. The defendant has failed or is not eligible for the Deferred Entry of Judgment Drug Program or the Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Program (SACPA - Prop. 36 Drug Program).</p><p>Participants are convicted felons or misdemeanants. Majority of drug courts include initial intensive treatment services with ongoing monitoring and continuing care. </p><p>Eligible defendants enter a guilty plea, and make regularly scheduled court appearances. These status hearings are for the purpose of promoting the treatment and rehabilitation of the defendant. A probation officer also works very closely with the defendant by monitoring program compliance and provides progress reports to the Court. </p><p>Upon successful completion of a drug treatment court program, the arrest upon which the judgment was deferred shall be deemed to have never occurred. The defendant may indicate in response to any question concerning his or her prior criminal record that he or she was not arrested or granted deferred entry of judgment for the offense, except as specified in Penal Code section 1001 subdivision (b). A record pertaining to an arrest resulting in successful completion of a deferred entry of judgment program shall not, without the defendant's consent, be used in any way that could result in the denial of any employment, benefit, license, or certificate.</p><p>If a defendant does not or cannot comply with requirements of the treatment program plan and discontinue the use of drugs, participation in the program is terminated. The defendant is returned to custody and criminal proceedings are reinstated. </p><hr><h4>Mental Health Court - Creating New Choices (CNC) Program </h4><p>The <u>Creating New Choices Mental Health Programs</u> are collaborative agreements between the Superior Court, Probation Department, Sheriff's Office, Department of Behavioral Health, District Attorney's Office, and Public Defender's Office, aimed at reducing the repetitive cycle of arrest and incarceration for defendants who have serious mental disorders. </p><p>The heart of the CNC Program is the multi-disciplinary team consisting of a Forensic Supervisor, Psychiatric Social Workers, a Behavioral Health Aide, a Probation Officer and a Psychiatrist, all of whom work together in developing individualized comprehensive treatment plans, providing intensive mental health and dual-diagnosis treatment, 24/7 support services, probation supervision, housing and benefit assistance, transportation, vocational and educational services (such as cognitive skills training and anger/stress management training), medication management/compliance and connections to community resources.</p><p>Once a defendant is referred to the Creating New Choices (CNC) Mental Health Court Program, the Court will then refer the defendant to Behavioral Health for an assessment and placement in an inpatient or outpatient program. Review hearings are regularly scheduled before the Court. These review hearings are for the purpose of promoting the treatment of the defendant. Defendants may receive Certificates of Achievements once milestones are reached. If satisfactory progress is made no further review hearings are set and a court date may be set for successful completion and possible dismissal. </p><hr><h4>What is Probation?</h4><p>Probation is a sentencing option for misdemeanor or felony offenses where the maximum penalty for the offense committed is not imposed by the Judge. When probation is granted, the defendant is allowed to remain a member of the community and serves only part of the sentence in jail, if any, with terms and conditions of probation imposed. </p><p>Defendants convicted of serious and violent offenses may not be eligible for probation.</p><p>Types of probation granted:</p><ul><li>Formal Probation (Supervised Probation)</li><li>Conditional probation (Court Probation)</li></ul><p>Formal Probation (or Supervised Probation) requires the defendant to meet with an assigned probation officer on a regular basis, usually once a month. </p><p>Conditional probation (or Court Probation) requires the defendant to complete certain terms of the sentence and obey all laws. Scheduled meetings with a probation officer are not necessary under conditional probation. </p><p>For all types of probation, a misdemeanor or felony sentence may include any or all of the following conditions: </p><ul><li>Informal or Formal Probation;</li><li>County Jail time;</li><li>Pay appropriate Fines and Fees as required by statute;</li><li>Pay Victim Restitution;</li><li>Participating in counseling;</li><li>Drug testing;</li><li>Other terms and conditions appropriate to the offense committed.</li></ul><h5>Length of Probation</h5><p>Generally, probation (formal and conditional) is granted from three to five years, but can vary depending on the charges and defendant's circumstances.</p><hr><h4>How Is Probation Violated? </h4><p>Probation can be violated in many ways. The most commons types of probation violations include:</p><ul><li><strong>Failure to Pay</strong> \u2013 When the defendant fails to pay required fines or restitution to the victim. </li><li><strong>Failure to Comply</strong> \u2013 Conditions of a defendant's probation may include to complete a court-ordered alcohol program, install an ignition interlock device or serve a county jail sentence. When the defendant fails to complete these required programs, a probation violation may occur. </li><li><strong>Failure to Appear</strong> \u2013 Many probation requirements include a scheduled court appearance for a progress report. When the defendant fails to appear for the required court appearance, a probation violation may occur. </li><li><strong>Failure to Report</strong> \u2013 Probation may require the defendant to report to a probation officer at scheduled times. Failure to appear when expected may result in a probation violation. </li><li><strong>Possession of Illegal Substances</strong> \u2013 When the defendant possesses illegal weapons or drugs, a probation violation may occur. </li><li><strong>Committing Crimes</strong> \u2013 Obeying all laws is mandatory during probation. When the defendant commits new crimes during the probationary period, a probation violation may occur. </li><li><strong>Being Arrested</strong> \u2013 Regardless of whether criminal charges are present, when the defendant is arrested during the probationary period, a probation violation may occur. </li><li><strong>Other Conditions</strong> \u2013 Any other terms and conditions imposed by the Judge at the time of sentencing and that the defendant has failed to comply with. </li></ul><h5>When Probation is Violated</h5><p>The penalties for a probation violation depend on the severity of the violation. In some cases, a second chance may be given and the probation violation will not affect the original terms or conditions of the probation. </p><p>When a probation violation occurs and the Court is informed of the Violation of Probation, the Judge may issue a warrant for the defendant's arrest. An arrest may follow shortly thereafter and/or the defendant may be ordered to court for a probation violation hearing. There are several factors that the judge and prosecutor use when considering a probation violation. Examples include: </p><ul><li>The seriousness of the probation violation</li><li>The nature of the probation violation</li><li>The history of previous probation violations</li><li>New criminal activity surrounding the probation violation</li><li>Aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the probation violation</li><li>The probation officer and/or probation department's view of the probation violation</li><li>The probation violation with respect to the probation term (whether it occurred at the beginning, middle, or end of the probationary term) </li></ul><h5>If a Warrant is Outstanding for a Violation of Probation </h5><ul><li>Conditional probation \u2013 You must contact the Clerk's Office to <a class=\"anchor-tag-inline\" href=\"/criminal/clerks-office\">Schedule an Appearance in Court.</a></li><li>Formal Probation \u2013 You must contact your probation officer or attorney.</li></ul><h5>Felony Case</h5><p>If you were convicted of a felony and placed on formal probation, you must contact your Probation Officer for filing a request for modification of sentence. </p><ul><li><strong>Formal Probation (Supervised Probation)</strong> requires the defendant to meet with an assigned probation officer on a regular basis to ensure defendant complete and comply with specific terms and conditions of the sentence and obey all laws. </li></ul><h5>Misdemeanor Case</h5><ul><li>Sentence (probation denied) requires the defendant to complete the sentencing terms imposed.</li><li>Conditional probation requires the defendant to complete and comply with specific terms and conditions of the sentence and obey all laws. </li></ul><p>If you fail to comply with a court sentence or the terms and conditions of your probation, a warrant may issue for your arrest for failure to comply with your sentence terms. If you were placed on probation, your probation may be violated, this action is known as a Violation of Probation.</p><hr><h4>How to Request a Modification of Sentence/Probation </h4><p>An Application for Modification of Sentence/Probation is a process for requesting the Court to modify the terms of a sentence or the terms and conditions of probation imposed at sentencing. This Application may be filed at any time after the original sentencing has occurred.</p><ol><li>Submit a completed <a href=\"https://mscpublicwebsiteprd.blob.core.windows.net/publicwebsiteprd/Form/MCR-4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">Application for Modification of Sentence form</a> with the <a class=\"anchor-tag-inline\" href=\"/criminal/clerks-office\">Clerk's Office.</a></li><li>After review and acceptance by the Clerk, the request will be submitted to the Judge for his/her review. </li><li>After review by the Judge, the Clerk will notify you of the Judge's decision: <ul><li>Request granted;</li><li>Request denied; or</li><li>You must appear in court to further explain to the Judge your request for the modification of sentence. </li></ul></li></ol></div><!----><!----><!----><!----></div>", "parent": ""},

Some common felony violations are: possession with intent to sell controlled substances, burglary, robbery, arson, carjacking, driving under the influence with bodily injury to another person, and serious assaults. </p><hr><h4>How a Criminal Case Begins</h4><p> Generally, when a crime is committed, the officer may arrest and place the suspect into custody or issue a citation and release the person on his/her own recognizance with a future court appearance date. The officer will submit a police report to the District Attorney's Office requesting a formal complaint be filed with the Court. </p><h5>Arrest - County Jail</h5><p> If the person is arrested, he/she will be booked into the Monterey County Jail on the alleged charges. The person may be: </p><ul><li>Released if not arraigned within the statutory time (generally within 48 hours)</li><li>Booked and released on his/her own recognizance with a future court appearance date</li><li>Released if bail is posted (cash or bond) with a future court appearance date.</li><li>Released on Pretrial Services Own Recognizance/ or Supervised Release</li></ul><h5>Bail</h5><p> Under California Penal Code 1272, the bail amount may be posted according to a <a class=\"anchor-tag-inline\" href=\"/bail-fee-schedules\">bail schedule</a>. Bail serves as a guarantee that the defendant will appear in court when required. Bail can be posted in one of the following forms: </p><p><strong>Cash Bail: </strong>Under California Penal Code 1272, the bail amount may be posted according to a bail schedule. </p><p><strong>Bail Bond (Surety bond): </strong>Bonds are posted by a California Bonds Company by an authorized Bail Bond Agency/Bail bondsman. Typically, the bail bondsman requires a deposit based on the bail amount. The bail bond agency posting the bond must guarantee the amount personally and financially. In the event that the defendant/accused does not appear in court after the bail is posted, then the bail bond could be forfeited and the bail bond agency must pay the entire amount of the bail to the Court \u2013 County. </p><p><strong>Property Bond: </strong>An inpidual guarantees the bail amount with property, such as real estate, and could lose that property through foreclosure if the defendant fails to appear in court. <a class=\"anchor-tag-inline\" href=\"/rules-of-court\">For more information please see the Criminal section of the Local Rules of Court</a>. </p><p><strong>Own Recognizance (OR): </strong>Defendants may be released on his/her OR without paying bail money or a bail bond, and are scheduled to appear at specific future court dates. If the defendant appears at all scheduled court appearances, the defendant will not be required to pay bail or be incarcerated while their case is pending. If the defendant fails to appear, the person may be arrested. </p><h5>District Attorney's Office</h5><p> The District Attorney (prosecutor) will review the police report to determine whether the person should be charged with a crime and, if so, what the crime should be. The prosecutor will review all reports and records, including witness statements. The prosecutor also reviews the person's prior criminal and/or DMV record. The District Attorney will prepare the charging document, the \"complaint,\" listing the charges brought against the person. </p><h5>City Attorney's Office</h5><p>The City Attorney (prosecutor) has the authority to enforce the municipal code within city limits.</p><h5>Complaint Filed with the Court</h5><p> The District Attorney or City Attorney will file the complaint with the Superior Court, Criminal Division. The complaint is filed on behalf of the State of California (plaintiff) against the accused person (defendant). </p><h5>Grand Jury Indictment Filed With The Court</h5><p> Another method for initiating charges against a defendant is a grand jury indictment. The grand jury, comprised of 19 jurors, determines whether probable cause exists based on evidence presented by the prosecutor. Grand jury proceedings are confidential and their actions become public only through the indictment, if one is filed. </p></div><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----></div>", "parent": ""},

In order to obtain a fee waiver, you must file an Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs at the time you file your answer. The Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs form may be obtained from the Clerk's Office. </p><br><h4>Writs of Possession and Notices to Vacate</h4><p>If the case goes to trial and the landlord wins the Unlawful Detainer lawsuit, the court will issue a judgment for possession. To enforce the judgment, the landlord will then obtain a Writ of Possession that directs the Sheriff to enforce the judgment for possession of the property. This legal document authorizes the Sheriff to physically remove and lock you out of the property. The Sheriff's cost from the eviction may be added to the judgment, which the landlord can collect from you.</p><p>The Sheriff will serve you with a Notice to Vacate the property before enforcing the Writ of Possession.

This default judgment allows the landlord to obtain possession of the property through a Notice to Vacate. </p><br><h4>The Right to a Jury Trial</h4><p>Both parties have the right to a jury trial. To request a jury trial, the requesting party must file a document entitled At Issue Memorandum. If one party files an At Issue Memorandum and does not request a jury trial, the other party has five days from the mailing date of the At Issue Memorandum to file a Counter At Issue Memorandum requesting a jury trial.

Checks or money orders should be made payable to Superior Court of California, County of Monterey. Note: There is a separate filing fee of $775 to be paid to the Court of Appeal. </p><p> If you cannot afford to pay the filing fees and other court costs, you may qualify for a waiver of those costs </p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mscpublicwebsiteprd.blob.core.windows.net/publicwebsiteprd/Misc/Fee%20Waiver%20Form.pdf\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\"> Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs </a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mscpublicwebsiteprd.blob.core.windows.net/publicwebsiteprd/Misc/Information%20Sheet%20on%20Waiver%20of%20Court%20Fees%20and%20Costs.pdf\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\"> Information Sheet on Waiver of Court Fees and Costs </a></li></ul><p> Failure to pay the filing fee or obtain a waiver may result in dismissal of your appeal. </p><h4> Designation of Transcripts </h4><p> Since the appellate court was not present at the trial or other proceedings, there must be an official record of the proceedings for the court to review in assessing the appeal. In criminal appeals, the court will prepare the standard record as specified in the California Rules of Court, unless the trial judge has granted a request for additional items. </p><p> In civil appeals, the appellant must tell the trial court what documents and oral proceedings, if any, to include in the record that will be sent to the appellate court. This is done by filing a Judicial Council <a href=\"http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/app003.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\"> Notice Designating the Record on Appeal</a>. The appellant's failure to file this notice may result in dismissal of the appeal. The respondent may also request documents by filing a Notice Designating the Record on Appeal; however, failure to do so will not affect the appeal. </p><p><b>Clerk's Transcript</b></p><p> The Clerk's Transcript is a compilation of the documents filed in the trial court. In criminal appeals, the Clerk's Transcript will include those documents required by the California Rules of Court. In civil appeals, you must designate each document you want included by its title and filing date. If the filing date is not known, the date the document was signed may be used instead. </p><p> The superior court clerk will send the parties a bill for the cost of preparing the Clerk's Transcript. The appellant is responsible for paying for the appellate court's copy as well as his own copy. The respondent may buy a copy of the transcript, but is not obligated to do so. Costs must be paid within 10 days or the appeal may be dismissed. (There is no charge for preparing the Clerk's Transcript in felony and death penalty appeals.) </p><p><b> Reporter's Transcript </b></p><p> A Reporter's Transcript is a written record (often called the \"verbatim\" record) of the oral proceedings in the trial court. A reporter's transcript is not required but is usually necessary. In felony and death penalty appeals, the Reporter's Transcript will include those hearing dates required by the California Rules of Court. In all other appeals, you must designate each date to be included. </p><p> With the notice designating the Reporter's Transcript, you must deposit the approximate cost of transcribing the proceedings designated. The cost of the Reporter's Transcript is $325 per fraction of a day for less than three hours of court time or $655 per day for more than three hours of court time. </p><h4> Briefs </h4><p> A brief is a party's written description of the facts in the case, the relevant law, and the party's argument. The brief must clearly explain, using references to the Clerk's and Reporter's Transcripts, the claimed legal errors in the trial court proceedings. </p><p> After the record is filed in the appellate court, you will receive a notice telling you when to file your brief. Read the notice carefully for directions on length and service. The appellant's failure to file an opening brief may result in dismissal of the appeal. </p><h4> Hearings </h4><p> When the record is filed in the appellate court, you will receive notice of the time and location for oral argument. This hearing will be set far enough in advance to allow time to get all briefs filed. </p><p> You may appear at oral argument or give up your right to argue your case at a hearing. If you give up that right, you should contact the Appeals Clerk in writing and tell the court you are submitting the appeal on the briefs and the record. If you attend the hearing, you cannot present witnesses or evidence. The judges will have read your briefs and the record, so try to stress the important points rather than reading your brief to the court. After the hearing, you will be informed by mail of the decision </p><h4> Felony, Misdemeanor, Juvenile Dependency and Juvenile Justice </h4><p> The Appeals Unit responsible for the filing of appeals in Felony, Misdemeanor, Juvenile Dependency and Juvenile Justice matters is located on the First Floor of the Courthouse at 240 Church Street, Salinas, CA 93901.

A paid Zoom account is not necessary for any interaction with the court.</li><li>Log onto <a href=\"https://zoom.us/profile\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">https://zoom.us/profile</a> and set your name, phone and email.

Below are a few settings recommended by the court to improve your video conference.</p><ul><li><strong>General:</strong> Ask me to confirm when I leave a meeting: ON (<em>Helps prevent unintended departures</em>)</li><li><strong>Video:</strong> Enable HD: OFF (<em>Helps prevent poor video performance, and usually looks just as good as HD</em>)</li><li><strong>Video:</strong> Always display participant names on their video: ON</li><li><strong>Video: </strong>Always show video preview dialog when joining a video meeting: ON (Final check before your video displays to others)</li></ul><h5><strong>Recommendations</strong></h5><ul><li>Mute your phone, and mute all sounds from all other applications (notifications, chat messaging, etc.).</li><li>Avoid using a mobile device if possible. Although tablets and smartphones can be used, they are very limited, and the performance is inferior.</li><li>Avoid using battery power only (laptops, etc.). Plug into a good power source while in a Zoom meeting.</li><li>Avoid using an open microphone and speakers, such as those built-into laptops or a webcams. Using a good quality headset will often help ensure you can be heard, and can hear others with maximum quality.</li><li>Headsets <strong></strong>(headphones with built-in \"boom\" microphone) prevent feedback, echo, and poor audio in the courtroom. Headsets with a \"boom mic\" placed close to your mouth are strongly preferred, and will help clarity when speaking through a mask.</li><li>All types of headsets are acceptable (1-ear or 2-ear, over-ear, in-ear, etc.), and can often be purchased at low cost. Wired headsets are strongly recommended due to their ease of use and reliability.</li><li>Wireless (Bluetooth) headsets can be unreliable and ear-bud style headsets (with the mic on the cord) may be too sensitive and can cause echo problems.</li><li>Avoid noisy and echoing locations. Use of a headset will improve audio quality when this is unavoidable.</li><li>Avoid distracting real or virtual backgrounds. <a href=\"http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ZoomGrey01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"anchor-tag-inline\">Suitable example</a>.</li><li>Avoid poor camera positioning.

Self-represented litigants are encouraged to electronically file with the court but are not mandated. </p><p><strong> Step One </strong>: To start e-filing is to select your service provider. An electronic filing service provider (EFSP) provides an online service to help you file your documents, and acts as the intermediary between you and the Odyssey eFileCA system. Each EFSP offers a variety of additional services and you should evaluate which provider meets your filing needs. Once you register with a service provider, you may not need to re-register should you choose to use another provider. Some providers allow you to log in with your existing username and password. </p><p> Currently, there are a number of EFSPs working to become certified with eFileCA and we expect the number of certified EFSPs to increase in the coming months.
