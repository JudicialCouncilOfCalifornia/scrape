(Ed) Wallin had a “wonderful upbringing” in a small house in Minneapolis, where he lived in a small corner in the basement. He was the first member of his extended family to go to college, commuting to the University of Minnesota during his undergraduate years (B.A. 1974) and law school (J.D., cum laude, 1967). At the time Wallin decided to go to law school, he did not even know a lawyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWallin accepted a legal position in the Orange County office of Kindel & Anderson, when he came out to interview during a very “cold winter.” He ended up working during his first three years at the U.S. Attorney’s office in Los Angeles, where he gained trial experience prosecuting mail fraud and obscenity cases. Wallin returned to Kindel & Anderson in 1970 as a “very experienced” trial lawyer and remained at the firm until 1978.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Bruce Sumner suggested that Governor Jerry Brown appoint Wallin to the superior court because of his business background and strong interest in public service. (Wallin was inspired by the example set by Minnesota’s Hubert Humphrey.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1978, Wallin became the youngest superior court judge in the state. He served on the Orange County Superior Court for over four years, three years of which he served as a law-and-motion judge. He handled a spate of newsworthy cases, including \u003cem\u003eDavidson v. City of Westminster\u003c/em\u003e (1982) 32 Cal.3d 197, where Wallin ruled (and the California Supreme Court unanimously affirmed) that police officers who were conducting a stakeout of a laundromat did not owe a duty of care to warn a patron when the suspected attacker entered the premises. “I ruled that the police did not have a duty to warn the woman,” Wallin said, “because it would be unfair to say our officers have to anticipate a crime so suddenly that they could rescue the citizen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a nationally significant case, Wallin ruled that federal law preempts state law restrictions on due-on-sale clauses in mortgage contracts for federally regulated lenders. The Supreme Court of the United States later upheld Wallin’s decision. (\u003cem\u003eFidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. de la Cuesta \u003c/em\u003e(1982) 458 U.S. 141.) According to Wallin, “it’s nice to know I got one right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1982, Brown elevated Wallin to Orange County’s newly formed appellate court, where he served as an associate justice for over 16 years. Wallin described the court’s early days: “Everybody just worked like crazy, because nobody knew what we were doing; we were all new.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWallin is responsible for a significant First Amendment opinion exonerating publishers from a broad duty to investigate the safety of advertised products. “Such a tort would require publications to maintain huge staffs scrutinizing and testing each product offered. The enormous cost of such groups, along with skyrocketing insurance rates, would deter many magazines from accepting advertising, hastening their demise from lack of revenue.” (\u003cem\u003eWalters v. Seventeen Magazine \u003c/em\u003e(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 1119 [magazine reader developed toxic shock after using advertised tampon product].)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWallin authored the court’s opinion in \u003cem\u003eGolden West Baseball Club v. City of Anaheim \u003c/em\u003e(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 11, at the time the most expensive civil litigation case in Orange County’s history, regarding disputed ownership over the parking lot for Anaheim Stadium, and conflicting promises to the Angels baseball club and the Los Angeles Rams football franchise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn another baseball case, Wallin affirmed a summary judgment for a Little League organization in a lawsuit brought by the parents of an 11-year old boy who was hit by an errant pitch while batting during a game. The parents argued the League negligently failed to remove the “wild pitcher” from the game because he earlier had struck two other players. Wallin concluded such risks were inherent in the sport. “Accuracy in pitching, especially from a teenager, has never been a prerequisite to being allowed to pitch. . . . To so hold would be to alter the fundamental nature of the game and most certainly chill vigorous participation.” (\u003cem\u003eBalthazor v. Little League Baseball, Inc. \u003c/em\u003e(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 47.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eSteiner v. Superior Court \u003c/em\u003e(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1771, Wallin authored an opinion rejecting efforts by the Orange County District Attorney to unseat two elected county supervisors for lax fiscal oversight resulting in the county’s bankruptcy. Wallin expressed the court’s concern on the impact on the democratic process were public officials to be removed from office for mere “neglect” in office. “It would effectively make the district attorney a performance monitor of elected officials, and allow him to subject them to the expense and rigors of accusation and trial if he deemed their performance to fall below that of the ‘reasonable’ public official. In plain terms, he could try to oust them for getting a C minus on their report cards.” Presiding Justice David Sills called this Wallin’s “finest decision.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWallin believed “very strongly in the public’s right to know what is occurring in the court system.” He was disinclined to “pontificate” in his legal opinions about extraneous matters, and he prided himself on his lack of dissents. Instead, he tried to work with his colleagues on panel in reaching a collegial result, with a high level of writing quality. “The court had one product: its opinions. Nothing else mattered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1994, Wallin received the Franklin G. West award from the Orange County Bar Association for lifetime achievement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1999, Wallin retired from the Court of Appeal and passed away in 2021.\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c!-- End Plain Text Module --\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003c/div\u003e",

Sills wanted to be a lawyer since was he was in the fifth grade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSills first came to Orange County in the 1950s for a Boy Scout “jamboree,” then later returned in 1962 while on active duty in the Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton, where he eventually attained the rank of captain. While there, he led his own armored company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSills majored in political science at Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois and earned his law degree from the University of Illinois in 1961. After concluding active duty with the Marines in 1965, he started a successful private law practice in Newport Beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSills served four separate terms as mayor of the City of Irvine in the 1970s and 1980s before Governor George Deukmejian appointed him to the bench, first to the Orange County Superior Court in 1985, and five years later as Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal. When asked why anyone would want the burdens of being a presiding justice, Sills, 52, responded, “It was the only job they offered me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring his 20-plus years on the appellate bench, Sills gained statewide recognition for his opinions and contributions to various areas of the law. He authored more than 2,400 majority opinions, almost 400 of which were certified for publication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSills was one of the first jurists to tackle legal issues relating to surrogacy (\u003cem\u003eIn re\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eMarriage of Moschetta\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1218; \u003cem\u003eIn re Marriage of Buzzanca\u003c/em\u003e (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1410), allowing this form of parentage to acquire legal recognition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSills drafted the opinion in a widely publicized guardianship case, ruling the trial court should have considered evidence regarding the father’s role in the mother’s death. “Judges cannot avoid the single most important and relevant issue in a case . . . just because trying that issue will take time. The standard is whether the consumption of time is ‘undue.’” (\u003cem\u003eGuardianship of Simpson\u003c/em\u003e (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 914.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSills wrote extensively on tort duties of care in cases like \u003cem\u003eAskew v.

In \u003cem\u003eIn re Marriage of Shaban \u003c/em\u003e(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 398, Sills firmly rejected the notion that experienced appellate practitioners should just recycle the work of trial lawyers: “Rather than being a rehash of trial level points and authorities, the appellate brief offers counsel probably their best opportunity to craft work of original, professional, and, on occasion, literary value.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSills’ legal opinions are noteworthy not just for groundbreaking issues, but for their literary and cultural allusions, ranging from Yogi Berra to Boren’s First Law of Bureaucracy to Shakespeare.

(Jack) Trotter was born in New York City, but moved with his family to San Diego County while he was in high school. Trotter said there were more people who lived in his Brooklyn apartment building than in his new hometown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrotter attended Loyola College (now Loyola Marymount University) on a basketball scholarship but was “scooped up” into the U.S. Army during the Korean War. Following his wartime service, Trotter resumed his college education at Santa Monica College. As a returning veteran with high grades, Trotter received early admittance into law school at the University of Southern California under a special program, receiving his law degree in 1961.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrotter immediately began a very active civil trial practice. Ed Wallin, later to serve with Trotter on the Court of Appeal, described him “as good a trial lawyer as there was in Southern California.” From 1978 to 1979, Trotter served as president of the Orange County Bar Association, where he worked to institute a night court program to hear domestic and business cases using volunteer attorneys as temporary judges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the early 1980s, Trotter was instrumental in forming Amicus Publico, an organization dedicated to promoting access to justice for persons who could not afford to hire private attorneys. In Trotter’s words, “We began the concept that lawyers should give time to those that can’t afford to pay for a lawyer—that there should be some basis on which these people could reach competent, good lawyers to represent them.” The group later evolved into Orange County’s Public Law Center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn April 1982, Governor Jerry Brown appointed Trotter, then a superior court judge, to the Court of Appeal’s Division Two in San Bernardino. At the time, Orange County had no appellate court of its own, although the Legislature shortly thereafter appropriated funds to establish a new Division Three in Orange County. In November 1982, the California Supreme Court cleared the last legal hurdle to the court’s formation, and Brown promptly designated Trotter to be the new division’s presiding justice. Trotter, at age 48, described himself as the “grey beard” of the court; his fellow justices, all appointed by Brown, were considerably younger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn January 3, 1983, the state’s newest appellate court held its first writs conference in Trotter’s breakfast room “with sunlight splashing through the patio doors and coffee brewing on a nearby counter . . . .” “All of a sudden you were a justice of the Court of Appeal with three others, and figuring out how to make it work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the court opened its doors in cramped rented office space, Trotter and his three judicial colleagues walked across Santa Ana Boulevard in their robes to hold the court’s first oral argument in the Santa Ana City Council chambers. The court came into existence with a 300-case backlog, and Trotter worked assiduously to manage the flow, but the court in the rapidly growing region was deluged with new appeals. “Each year that this buildup continues,” he observed, we add four to six months to the delay in the average case.” Trotter attributed the crush to the predominance of complex civil cases within the division.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo speed up the process, Trotter instituted an automation program at the court to enable individual justices to type their opinions directly into a computer, rather than writing them by hand. By 1985, Trotter and his colleagues were averaging about 140 opinions per year — more opinions per justice than elsewhere in the state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of Trotter’s most noteworthy opinions required public entities to publicly disclose previously secret settlement agreements with tort litigants. The court granted a newspaper’s request to discover notes and reports by the county’s claims settlement committee in a police misconduct lawsuit brought by a jail inmate. Trotter concluded “the public interest in finding out how decisions to spend public funds are formulated and insuring governmental processes remain open and subject to public scrutiny” outweighed any interest in keeping secret its settlement policy and decisions.

Sonenshine, one of the original justices appointed to Division Three, served on the court for 17 years. Sonenshine grew up in Las Vegas, Nevada through the fifth grade but persuaded her parents to send her to California to attend the Chadwick School in Palos Verdes. She later described her Chadwick years as a “fantastic experience”; even in the early 1960s, “Chadwick was one of the only, if not the only, co-ed private boarding school that never really had gender boundaries,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile at UCLA, Sonenshine worked for over two years at Neighborhood Legal Services, where she was the organization’s first employee. Her experience confirmed her desire to be a lawyer, and her abiding interest in pro bono work. After graduating as an economics major from UCLA in 1967, Sonenshine pursued her legal studies at Loyola Law School, receiving a juris doctor degree in 1970.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonenshine opened her own law office in Newport Beach. She focused on family law, and became one of the first certified family law specialists in the state. Her firm grew to 10 lawyers when she left in 1982 to join the Orange County Superior Court. As a judge, Sonenshine was unafraid to jail deadbeat spouses for failing to pay spousal or child support. “The philosophy has changed dramatically. The courts didn’t used to look at that crime the same as it did other offenses,” Sonenshine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShortly thereafter, Governor Jerry Brown elevated Sonenshine to the newly created Division Three, where she was one of the youngest appointees on the court, and inaugurated the state’s first mandatory judicial settlement program. To further the settlement process, Sonenshine penned a widely cited opinion empowering courts to require persons with “meaningful” settlement authority to personally appear at settlement conferences. (\u003cem\u003eSigala v. Anaheim City School Dist. \u003c/em\u003e(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 661.) “The major purpose of a settlement conference is not to ‘clear the docket,’ but to achieve justice. For the litigants, settlement may be the best method of reaching this goal. And even when a settlement is not achieved, . . [e]ach party is able to gain valuable insight into the viability of the opponent’s position as well as perhaps unperceived weaknesses in its own case.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonenshine authored a leading decision on HIV and infectious diseases, holding a public school was required to educate an 11-year old boy who tested positive for the AIDS virus as a result of a blood transfusion.

It is irrelevant whether the action involves hiring, firing or discipline or simply changes the terms and conditions of the employment.

Writing on a matter of first impression, Moore determined that the suitability standard properly focused on where an action could be brought, not where it could be won. “While an alternative forum must be open to the plaintiff and the defendant must be amenable to jurisdiction there, the law does not require that the alternative forum, in order to be ‘suitable,’ provide equivalent relief.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoore has been widely cited for a dependency opinion regarding the primacy of the best interests of children: “Children should not be required to wait until their parents grow up.” (\u003cem\u003eIn re Rikki D.\u003c/em\u003e (1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1624.)

According to Moore, the executor had no duty to investigate whether the creditor had a more appropriate address: “A rule justifying a delay caused by a business’s or other entity’s internal procedure in handling mail would reward inefficiency and create havoc in the administration of estates.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoore, 61, died in 1994 while still a member of the court following a long battle with leukemia. “I think the one thing that everyone remembers about Hank was his love of the law,” then Presiding Justice David G.

Griffin was born on a farm at San Luis Rey in San Diego County on February 2, 1895. His grandparents were the first American settlers in San Diego County in 1862, when they came to the San Luis Rey Valley from Texas in an ox-drawn covered wagon. After his father died and his family moved to San Diego when he was 17, the Board of Supervisors of which his father had been chairman gave him a job as a messenger boy at the courthouse at $40 a month. While studying law at night, he quickly moved from messenger boy to assistant law librarian, court commissioner and then to deputy clerk. He was admitted to the California Bar at 21 without the benefit of a formal college education. After serving as deputy District Attorney for several years, he was appointed to the Justice Court in 1923 and later elevated to the San Diego County Superior Court in 1927 - an office he held for 11 years. On October 1, 1938, Governor Frank Merriam appointed him Associate Justice for the Fourth District Court of Appeal and he took the oath of office the same day. He was elevated to Presiding Justice on July 25, 1958, a title he held until his retirement on February 1, 1965. His tenure at the Court is only second to that of his colleague, Presiding Justice Barnard. He served four years on the Judicial Council, as well as four years on the Commission on Judicial Qualifications -- a group he chaired at the time of his retirement. After retiring, he associated with the law firm of Higgs, Fletcher and Mack. Like many of his contemporaries, he was very active in several fraternal orders.

At age 21, he was elected city clerk of Colusa, but left the position to take over the editorial responsibilities for the Oroville Mercury. Less than a year later, Hart purchased the Willows Journal, which he published until 1884, at which time he sold the paper and moved to Sacramento to study law under the tutelage of his brother, A.L. Hart (Attorney General of the State). He was admitted to practice in 1885, and the following year was elected City Attorney of Sacramento, a position he held until 1888, when he was elected to the State Assembly. In 1890, he was elected again as City Attorney, and served until November 1892, when he was elected to the California State Senate. In 1896 he was appointed Judge of the Superior Court of Sacramento, and in 1906 he was elected to the Court of Appeal, Third Appellate District, where he served for 22 years.
